<h1>
     Package Tour
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

One of the most profound benefits of object-oriented programming
is reusability--programmers can save time, effort, and money by
reusing objects created by other programmers.
Typically, to make objects easier to find and use, and to avoid
naming conflicts, programmers
bundle groups of related objects into class libraries. 
In Java, class libraries are called <em>packages</em>.
<p>
Several packages of reusable classes are shipped
as part of the Java development environment.
Many of these packages also include interface and exception definitions.

<h4>
<a href=java.lang.html>The Java Language Package</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
This package provides classes that are core to the Java
language. Even though the classes in this packages are
generally useful, if you are writing stand-alone Java
applications, you are likely to need the classes and
interfaces in this package first, and if you are writing
applets, you are likely to need the classes in the Applet
and Abstract Window Toolkit packages first.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=java.io.html>The Java I/O Package</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
The Java I/O Package provides a set of input and output
streams used to read and write data to files or other input
and output sources.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=java.util.html>The Java Utility Package</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
This Java package contains a collection of utility classes.
Among them are several generic data structures (Dictionary,
Stack, Vector, Hashtable) a useful object for tokenizing a
string and another for manipulating calendar dates.
The java.util package also contains the Observer interface
and Observable class which allow objects to notify one
another when they change.
</blockquote>

<h4>The Java Networking Package
</h4>
<blockquote>
Various networking classes comprise this package including
classes that represent a URL and a URL connection,
classes that implement a socket connection, and a class that
represents an internet address.
</blockquote>

<h4>The Applet Package</h4>
<blockquote>
This package contains the Applet class -- the class that you must
subclass if you're writing an applet. Included in this package
is the AudioClip interaface which provides a very high level
abstraction of audio.
</blockquote>

<h4>The Abstract Window Toolkit Package
</h4>
<blockquote>
This toolkit provides GUI elements used to get input from and display information
to the user such as windows, buttons, scrollbars, and text items.
This packages, also known as the AWT, has two related packages: the
java.awt.image and java.awt.peer packages.
