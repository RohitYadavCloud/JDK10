<h3>This Is a DRAFT!</h3>

<blockquote>
This tutorial is a <strong>DRAFT</strong>:
it's incomplete, buggy, and may contain bad links.
We're making this tutorial available to you for two reasons:
<ol>
<li> So you can learn from it --
     some of the information in this tutorial
     is not documented anywhere else.
<li> So we can get feedback on this tutorial.
</ol>

To help us with #2, please let us know what's confusing in these lessons,
what seems unnecessary,
and whether the lessons helped you at all.

<h3>How to Get the Tutorial</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
The Java Language Tutorial lives at our website along with all of our other
documentation. You can read it "over-the-wire" by clicking on this link
to the tutorial's <a href="index.html">Trail Map</a> or you can

?
</h3>

<blockquote>
<strong>23 Jan 96</strong> -- Updated the Second DRAFT
<ul>
<li> Updated links to point to new FCS1.0 JDK release.
<li> Fixed bugs where some applets and sources files were missing.
<li> Miscellaneous fixes of typos, bugs, and broken links. 
</ul>

<strong>18 Jan 96</strong> -- Updated the Second DRAFT
<ul>
<li> Changed the <a href="ui/index.html">Creating a User
     Interface<img src="images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
     trail to reflect the event changes introduced in Beta2.
     Specifically, keyboard event handlers now have to return false,
     unless they want the event to be dropped.
     The Conversion example program and the overview were affected.
<li> Revised the structure of the tutorial 
     to reflect what we're going to be able to finish
     by the time the book version is due to the printer.
<li> Added a very preliminary lesson on Java's object features--
     <a href="java/javaOO/index.html">Java Objects</a>.
<li> Fixed various typos, bugs and broken links.
</ul>

<strong>12 Dec 95</strong> -- Updated the Second DRAFT
<ul>
<li>
Made the few changes necessary to reflect Beta2 instead of Beta.
<li>
Fixed various typos, bugs and broken links.
<li>
<a href="mailto:jan@tdb.uu.se">Jan K&auml;rrman</a>
from Uppsala University, Sweden, gave us a new version of the Perl script,
<a href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps0.2a.html">html2ps</a>,
that we use to generate PostScript files from HTML. This new version
supports images, page breaks, and page numbers. So, now there is only one
PostScript file per lesson. You can <a href=#DOWNLOADING>download</a>
the PostScript files or the HTML versions.
<li>
Added a new lesson,
<a href="java/exceptions/index.html">Handling Errors using Exceptions</a>, in the
<a href="java/index.html">Writing Java Programs</a>
<a href="java/index.html"><img src="images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail.
</ul>

<strong>13 Nov 95</strong> -- Updated the Second DRAFT
<ul>
<li>
Made the few changes necessary to reflect Beta instead of Pre-Beta.
<li>
Changed the name of this document from
"The Java Programmer's Guide" to
"The Java Language Tutorial: Object-Oriented Programming for the Internet."
Why the long name?
This document is going to be published as a book,
and we wanted to make sure the title
was as descriptive as possible,
without requiring much prior knowledge of the potential buyer.
<li>
Added ALT text to our link graphics, 
so that people using non-graphical browsers
can understand the information the graphic was conveying.
<li>
Added a new lesson,
<a href="ui/layout/index.html">Using Layout Managers</a>, in the
<a href="ui/index.html">Creating a User Interface</a>
<a href="ui/index.html"><img src="images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail.
</ul>

<strong>2 Oct 95</strong> -- Released the Second DRAFT
<ul>
<li>
Everything was updated to reflect the new APIs (except for <i>The "run:"
Protocol Handler</i> and <i>The "text/plain" Content Handler</i>
in the <a href="getStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a>
<a href="getStarted/index.html"><img src="images/getStartedIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail).
<li>
We fixed many typos, clarified many obfuscations, fixed
broken links and miscommunications.
<li>
We got a face-lift with new icons and a new page design.
<li>
And, we added these trails and lessons:
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="applet/index.html">Writing Applets</a>
<a href="applet/index.html"><img src="images/appletIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail has a new lesson:
<a href="applet/overview/index.html">Overview of Applets</a>
which describes
how applets work and how you use the Applet class to create an applet.

<li>
The new
<a href="ui/index.html">Creating a User Interface</a>
<a href="ui/index.html"><img src="images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail has two new lessons:
<a href="ui/overview/index.html">Overview of UI Elements</a> which
introduces you to the objects that the Java development environment
provides for building UIs, and 
<a href="ui/layout/index.html">Arranging Components within a Container</a>
which tells you how to use each of the Components provided in the AWT.

<li>
We've added a trail
<a href="tools/index.html">The Java Development Environment</a>
<a href="tools/index.html"><img src="images/toolIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
that provides a tour of the packages provided with the development environment,
talks about the different tools including the new prototype debugger. This trail
includes a lesson on <a href="tools/system/index.html">Using System Resources</a>.

<li>
We've also added the
<a href="native/index.html">Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</a>
<a href="native/index.html"><img src="images/nativeIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail that shows you how to integrate native methods
into your Java programs. Currently, this trail contains two lessons.
The first, <a href="native/stepbystep/index.html">Step By Step</a>,
 walks you through an example showing you each step you take to
implement a native method. The second, 
<a href="native/example/index.html">A Comprehensive Example</a>,
which is largely unfinished, is an example that implements a
"character-replacement" program using native methods.

<li>
And finally, two new lessons have been added to the
<a href="java/index.html">Writing Java Programs</a>
<a href="java/index.html"><img src="images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail:
<a href="java/threads/index.html">Threads of Control</a>
and
<a href="java/objects/index.html">Object-Oriented Programming Concepts: A Primer</a>.
</ul>
</ul>

<a name=APPLETREFS>
<h3>About the Tutorial's Applets</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
Most applets in these pages actually are references to two
different versions of the applet:
<ul>
<li>
a 1.0alpha3 compatible version
which you can view these using the 1.0alpha3 version of the HotJava browser
<li>
a Beta-compatible version which you can view these
using the appletviewer or other Beta-compatible browser
</ul>
<br>

<strong>
Note to 1.0alpha3 Developers:
</strong>
This programmer's tutorial doesn't contain any information on how to
upgrade your 1.0alpha3 Java applets to the 1.0 Beta release.
For more information on how to do this please refer to
<a href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-beta/converting/index.html">Converting Applets</a>.
