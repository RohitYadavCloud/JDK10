<h1>
     Overview of Applets
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

This lesson discusses the parts of an applet.
If you haven't yet compiled an applet and included it in an HTML page,
you might want to do so now.
Step by step instructions are in 
<a href="../../getStarted/applet/index.html"><b>Getting
Started: The "Hello World" Applet</b>
<img src="../../images/getStartedIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>.
<p>

Every applet is implemented by creating a subclass of the Applet class.
The following figure shows the inheritance hierarchy of the Applet class.
This hierarchy determines much of what an applet can do and how,
as you'll see on the next few pages.
<p>

<pre>
java.lang.Object
   |
   +----java.awt.Component
           |
           +----java.awt.Container
                   |
                   +----java.awt.Panel
                           |
                           +----java.applet.Applet

<h4>A Simple Applet</h4>
<blockquote>
Below is the source code for an applet called Simple.
The Simple applet displays a descriptive string
whenever it encounters a major milestone in its life,
such as when the user first visits the page the applet's on.
The pages that follow
use the Simple applet and build upon it
to illustrate concepts that are common to many applets.
If you find yourself baffled by Java source code,
you might want to go to 
<a href="../../java/index.html"><b>Writing Java Programs</b>
<img src="../../images/getStartedIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
to learn about the language.
<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class Simple extends java.applet.Applet {

    StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();

    public void init() {
	resize(500, 20);
        addItem("initializing... ");
    }

    public void start() {
        addItem("starting... ");
    }

    public void stop() {
        addItem("stopping... ");
    }

    public void destroy() {
	addItem("preparing for unloading...");
    }

    public void addItem(String newWord) {
	System.out.println(newWord);
	buffer.append(newWord);
	repaint();
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
	g.drawRect(0, 0, size().width - 1, size().height - 1);
	g.drawString(buffer.toString(), 5, 15);
    }
}

<h4><a href="lifeCycle.html">The Life Cycle of an Applet</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
You can use the Simple applet to learn
about the milestones in every applet's life.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="appletMethods.html">Methods for Milestones</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>

The Applet class provides a framework for applet execution,
defining methods that the system calls
when milestones -- major events in an applet's life cycle -- occur.
Every applet must override some or all of these methods
to respond appropriately.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="componentMethods.html">Methods for Drawing and Event Handling</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Applets inherit the drawing and event handling methods
of the AWT Component class.
(AWT stands for Advanced Windowing Toolkit; 
it's the package that applets and applications use
to produce user interfaces.)
<em>Drawing</em> refers to anything related to 
representing an applet on-screen --
drawing images,
presenting user interface components such as buttons,
or using graphics primitives.
<em>Event handling</em> refers to detecting and processing
user input such as mouse clicks and key presses,
as well as more abstract events
such as saving files and iconifying windows.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="containerMethods.html">Methods for Adding UI Components</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Applets inherit from the AWT Container class.
This means that they are designed to hold Components --
user interface objects
such as buttons, labels, pop-up lists, and scrollbars.
Like other Containers, applets use layout managers
that control the positioning of Components.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="threads.html">Threads in Applets</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Even the simplest applets run in multiple threads,
although it's not always apparent.
Many applets create and use their own threads,
so that they perform well
without affecting the performance of the applet viewer or of other applets.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="security.html">What Applets Can and Can't Do</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
For security reasons, 
applets that are loaded over the network
have several restrictions.
One is that an applet can't ordinarily read or write files
on the computer that it's executing on.
Another is that an applet can't make network connections
except to the host that it came from.
Despite these restrictions,
applets can do some things 
that you might not expect.
