<h2>
    What Applets Can and Can't Do
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

For security reasons, 
an applet that's loaded over the network
has the following restrictions:
<ul>
<li> It can't load libraries or define native methods.
<li> It can't ordinarily read or write files
     on the host that's executing it.
<li> It can't make network connections
     except to the host that it came from.
<li> It can't start any program on the host that's executing it.
<li> It can't read every system property.
<li> Windows that an applet brings up
     are distinguished by some warning text
     and either a colored bar or an image,
     so that the windows don't look
     like they're part of a trusted application.
</ul>
<p>

Things that applets can do, 
that you might not expect:
<ul>
<li> Applets that are loaded from the local file system
     (from a directory in the user's CLASSPATH
     [or from a file URL?])
     have none of the restrictions
     that applets loaded over the network do (as listed above).
     For this reason, 
     some browsers don't allow applets to be loaded
     via file: URLs.
<li> Although most applets stop running once you leave their page,
     they don't have to.
</ul>
<p>

Each browser has a SecurityManager object 
that checks for applet security violations.
When a SecurityManager detects a violation,
it throws a SecurityException.

[ need an example applet that tries to do a few forbidden things ]
