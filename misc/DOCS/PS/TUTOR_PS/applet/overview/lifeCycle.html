<h2>
    The Life Cycle of an Applet
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>



<a name="output">
<!--FILE BUG; THIS DOESN'T WORK when put around the APP tag; SHOULDN'T IT?-->
Below (if you're running a Java-compatible browser)
is the Simple applet.
</a>
<p>

<applet code="Simple.class" codebase=betaclasses width=500 height=20>
<APP class=Simple width=500 height=20>
</applet>
<p>

<a name="loading"><h4>Loading the Applet</h4></a>
<blockquote>
You should see "initializing... starting..." above,
as the result of the applet being loaded.
When an applet is loaded,
here's what happens:
<ul>
<li> An instance of the applet's controlling class is created.
<li> The applet <b>initializes</b> itself.
<li> The applet <b>starts</b> running.
</ul>

</blockquote>

<a name="leaving"><h4>Leaving and Returning to the Applet's Page</h4></a>
<blockquote>
When the user leaves the page
-- for example, to go to another page --
the applet has the option of <b>stopping</b> itself.
When the user returns to the page,
the applet can <b>start</b> itself again.
The same thing happens when the user iconifies
the browser window that contains the applet.

<p>

<strong>Try this:</strong>
Leave and then return to this page.
You'll see "stopping..." added to the
<a href="#output">applet output above</a>,
as the applet is given the chance to stop itself.
You'll also see "starting...",
when the applet is told to start itself again.
<p>

<strong>Try this:</strong>
Iconify this window.
Most window systems provide a button in the title bar
that lets you do this.
(Other terms used instead of "iconify" are "miniaturize" or "close".)
You should see "stopping..." and then "starting..."
added to the 
<a href="#output">applet output above</a>.
</blockquote>

<a name="reloading"><h4>Reloading the Applet</h4></a>
<blockquote>
Some browsers let the user reload applets,
which consists of unloading the applet and then loading it again.
Before an applet is unloaded, 
it's given the chance to <b>stop</b> itself
and then to perform a <b>final cleanup</b>,
so that the applet can release any resources it holds.
After that, the applet is unloaded
and then loaded as described in
<a href="#loading"><b>Loading the Applet</b></a>,
above.
<p>

<strong>Try this:</strong>
If you're using the HotJava browser,
look at the 
<a href="_stdout.html">standard output</a>
to see what happens when you reload this page.
You should see "stopping..." and "preparing for unloading..."
when the applet is unloaded.
(You can't see this in the applet above
because the applet is unloaded before the text can be displayed.)
When the applet is reloaded,
you should see "initializing..." and "starting...",
just like when you loaded the applet for the first time.
<em>(It appears that the 1.0beta3 Netscape browser reloads the applet
only if its reloaded page has changed. 
If the page hasn't changed, 
the browser appears to act as if you temporarily left the page.)</em>
</blockquote>

<a name="quitting"><h4>Quitting the Browser</h4></a>
<blockquote>
When the user quits the browser 
(or whatever application is displaying the applet),
the applet has the chance to <b>stop</b> itself and do <b>final cleanup</b>
before the browser exits.
</blockquote>
