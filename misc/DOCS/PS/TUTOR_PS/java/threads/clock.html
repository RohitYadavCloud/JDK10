<h2>
    The Clock Applet
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The Clock applet shown here: <applet codebase=betaclasses code=Clock.class
width=60 height=10><app class=Clock width=60 height=10></applet> displays the
current time and updates its display every second.
You can scroll this page and perform other tasks while the
clock continues to update because the code that updates the
clock's display runs within its own thread.
<p>
This page highlights and explains the <a href=betaclasses/Clock.java>source
code</a> for the clock applet in detail. In particular, this page 
describes the code segments that implement the clock's threaded behaviour;
it does not describe the code segments that are related to the life
cycle of the applet. If you have not written your own applets before
or are not familiar with the life cycle of any applet, you may want
to take this time to familiarize yourself with the material in
<a href=../../applet/anatomy/lifeCycle.html>The Life Cycle of an Applet</a>
<a href=../../applet/anatomy/lifeCycle.html><img src=../../images/appletIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a> 
before proceeding with this page.

<p>
<h4>The Decision to Use the Runnable Interface</h4>
<blockquote>
The Clock applet uses the Runnable interface to provide the
<code>run()</code> method for its thread. In order to run within a
Java-compatible browser, the Clock class had to derive from the Applet
class. However, the Clock applet also needs to use a thread so that it
can continuously update its display without taking over the process in
which it is running. But since the Java language does not support multiple-inheritance,
the Clock class could not inherit from Thread as well as from Applet.
Thus, the Clock class uses the Runnable interface to provide its
threaded behaviour.

<p>
Applets are not threads nor do Java-compatible browsers or appletviewers
automatically create threads in which to run applets. Therefore, if
an applet needs any threads it must create its own. The clock applet
needs one thread in which to perform its display updates because it
updates its display frequently and the user needs to be able to perform
other tasks at the same time the clock is running (such as going to
another page, or scrolling this one).
</blockquote>

<h4>The Runnable Interface</h4>
<blockquote>
The Clock applet provides a <code>run()</code> method for its thread
via the Runnable interface. The class definition for the Clock class
indicates that the Clock is a subclass of Applet and implements the
Runnable interface. If you are not familiar with interfaces review
the information at <a href=../../MissingPage.html><strong>Missing Page</strong></a>.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Clock extends Applet <strong>implements Runnable</strong> {
</pre>
</blockquote>
The Runnable interface defines a single method called <code>run()</code>
that takes no arguments and returns no value. Because the Clock class
implements the Runnable interface, it must provide an implementation
for the <code>run()</code> method as defined in the interface.
However, before explaining the Clock's <code>run()</code> method
we need to look at some of the other elements of the Clock code first.
</blockquote>

<h4>Creating the Thread</h4>
<blockquote>
The application in which an applet is running calls the applet's
<code>start()</code> method when it loads the applet. The Clock applet
creates a Thread named <code>clockThread</code> in its <code>start()</code>
method and starts the thread.
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void start() {
    if (clockThread == null) {
        clockThread = new Thread(this, "Clock");
        clockThread.start();
    }
}    
</pre>
</blockquote>
First, the <code>start()</code> method checks to see if <code>clockThread</code>
is null. If <code>clockThread</code> is null, then the applet is brand new or
has been previously stopped and a new thread must be created. Otherwise, the
applet is already running. The applet creates a new thread
with this invocation:
<blockquote>
<pre>
clockThread = new Thread(this, "Clock");
</pre>
</blockquote>
Notice that <code>this</code>--the Clock applet--is passed in as the first
argument to the thread constructor. The first argument to this Thread constructor
must implement the Runnable interface and becomes the thread's <em>target</em>.
When constructed in this way, the thread, <code>clockThread</code>, gets its
<code>run()</code> method from its target Runnable object, in this case,
the Clock applet.
<p>
The second argument is just a name for the thread.
</blockquote>

<h4>Stopping the Thread</h4>
<blockquote>
When you leave the page that displays the Clock applet, the application in which
the applet is running calls the applet's <code>stop()</code> method. The Clock's
<code>stop()</code> method stops the thread then sets it to null. This stops
the continual updating of the clock.
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void stop() {
    clockThread.stop();
    clockThread = null;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
If you revisit the page, the <code>start()</code> method is called again,
and the clock starts up again with a new thread.
</blockquote>

<h4> The Run Method</h4>
<blockquote>
And finally for the Clock's <code>run()</code> method.
The <code>run()</code> method implements the heart of the Clock applet
and looks like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void run() {
    while (clockThread != null) {
        repaint();
        try {
            clockThread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e){
        }
    }
}   
</pre>
</blockquote>
As you saw in the previous section, when the applet is asked to stop, the applet
stops the <code>clockThread</code> and then sets it to null; this lets
the <code>run()</code> method know when to stop. Thus the first
line of the <code>run()</code> method loops until <code>clockThread</code>
is stopped. Within the loop, the applet repaints itself, and then
tells the Thread to sleep for 1 second (1000 milliseconds).
An applet's <code>repaint()</code> method ultimately calls the applet's
<code>paint()</code> method which does the actual update of the applet's
display area. The Clock applet's <code>paint()</code> method gets the
current time and draws it to the screen.
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    Date now = new Date();
    g.drawString(now.getHours() + ":" + now.getMinutes() + ":" + now.getSeconds(), 5, 10);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
