<h2>
    Thread Body
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

All the action takes place in the thread body which is the thread's
<code>run()</code> method. After a thread has been created and
initialized, the runtime system calls its <code>run()</code> method.
The code in the <code>run()</code> method implements the behaviour
for which the thread was created. It's the thread's raison d'etre
(reason to be).
<p>
Often, a thread's <code>run()</code> method is a loop. For example,
an animation thread might loop through and display a series of images.
Sometimes a thread's <code>run()</code> method performs an operation that
takes a long time. For example, downloading and playing a sound
or a JPEG movie.
<p>
There are two different ways that you can provide a customized
<code>run()</code> method for a Java thread:
<ol>
<li>
Subclass the Thread class defined in the java.lang package and
override the <code>run()</code> method.
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> The SimpleThread class used in the the example
described in <a href="simple.html">A Simple Thread Example</a> previously in
this lesson is an example of this style of using Java threads.
<li>
Provide a class that implements the Runnable interface, also defined
in the java.lang package. Now, when you instantiate a thread (either directly
from the Thread class, or from a subclass of Thread), give the new
thread a handle to an instance of your Runnable class. This Runnable
object provides the <code>run()</code> method to the thread.
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> The clock applet you see here <applet
codebase=betaclasses code=Clock.class width=60 height=10><app class=Clock width=60 height=10></applet>
is an example of using the Runnable interface to provide a <code>run()</code>
method to a thread.
<a href="clock.html"><strong>The Clock Applet</strong></a>
describes the source code for this simple applet.
</ol>

There are good reasons for choosing either of the two options described
above over the other. However, for most cases, the following rule of
thumb will guide you to the best option.

<hr>
<strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If your class <em>must</em> derive from
some other class (the most common example being Applet), then you should
use Runnable as described in Option #2.
