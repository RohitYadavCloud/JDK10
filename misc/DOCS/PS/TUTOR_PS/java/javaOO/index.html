<strong>Author's Note:</strong> This lesson on using Java's
object features is <em>very</em> preliminary.
It is likely that much of this lesson will change significantly
in structure, organization and content. Also, there are many
partially written sections, either missing or poor transitions,
and many missing pages. Please bear with us.
<hr>

In the lesson titled
<a href="../objects/index.html">Object-Oriented Programming Concepts: A Primer</a><a href="../objects/index.html"><img src="../../images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Writing Java Programs trail)"></a>
you learned the concepts behind object-oriented programming.
Now that you have an abstract understanding of object-oriented
programming, it's time to get to work and put those concepts
to practical use.
This lesson shows you how to use and abuse the object-oriented
paradigms of the Java language.
<p>
In this lesson, you will learn how to create and destroy objects,
how to create and subclass classes, and how to write methods.
This lesson covers everything including how to protect the innards of
an object from groups of other objects, override methods,
create class templates using abstract classes and methods,

<h4>The Life Cycle of an Object</h4>
<blockquote>
An object is a software module that has state and behaviour. An object's
state is contained within its variables and its behaviour is implemented
through its methods. The typical life-cycle of an object is 1) creation,
2) use, and 3) destruction. After an object has been created, any other
object (that has access) can use its methods, or, inspect its variables.
An object remains "alive" until no other objects are using it. Once an
object has completed its useful life, you don't have to do anything--the
Java runtime system will clean it up for you!

<h4><a href="classes.html">Creating Your Own Class</a></h4>
<blockquote>
A Java object is an <em>instance of a class</em>.
Frequently, we say that an object's class is the object's <em>type</em>.
The Java development environment comes with many classes that you can
use in your programs. Or you can write your own. This section shows
you how to write your own class including how to declare a class,
declare its variables, and write its methods.
