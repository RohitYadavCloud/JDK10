<h2>
    Controlling Access to a Class's Variables
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The Java language supports five distinct access levels for
variables: private, private protected, protected, public, and,
if left unspecified, "friendly". The following chart shows
the access level permitted by each specifier.
<blockquote>
<pre>
				sub-	pack-
Specifier		class	class	age	world
-----------------------------------------------------
private			X
private protected	X	X
protected		X	X*	X
public			X	X	X	X

friendly		X	 	X
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first column indicates whether or not the class itself has access
to the variable defined by the access specifier. The second
column indicates whether or not subclasses of the class (regardless of
which package they are in) have access to the variable. The
third column indicates whether or not classes in the same package
(regardless of their parentage) as the class have access to the
variable. And finally, the fourth column indicates that all
classes have access to the variable.
<p>
You'll note that the protected access specifier/sub-class intersection
has an '*' -- this indicates that this particular access case
has a special caveat which is discussed in detail <a href=#protectedcaveat>below</a>.
<p>
Let's look at each access level in more detail.

<h4>Private</h4>
<blockquote>
Let's begin with the most restrictive access level--private.
A private variable is only accessible to the class in which
it is defined.
To declare a private variable, use the keyword <code>private</code>.
For example, the following class defines one private variable within it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    private int iamprivate;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Objects of type Alpha can inspect or modify the <code>iamprivate</code> variable,
but objects of other types cannot. For example, the following class,
regardless of which package it is in or its parentage, cannot access the <code>iamprivate</code>
variable within the Alpha class.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprivate = 10;	// illegal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can tell when one of your classes is attempting to access a variable to
which it does not have access--the compiler will print an error message similar
to the following and refuse to compile your program.
<blockquote>
<pre>
Beta.java:9: Variable iamprivate in class Alpha not accessible from class Beta.
        a.iamprivate = 10;     // illegal
         ^
1 error
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Private Protected</h4>
<blockquote>
The next most restrictive access specified is private protected. This
access level includes the same access level as private plus allows
any of the class's subclasses to access the variable.
To declare a private protected variable, use the keywords <code>private protected</code>.
For example, the following class defines one one private protected variable within it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    private protected int iamprivateprotected;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Objects of type Alpha can inspect or modify the <code>iamprivateprotected</code>
variable. In addition, subclasses of Alpha also have access to
<code>iamprivateprotected</code>. For instance, this subclass of
Alpha can assign its <code>iamprivateprotected</code> variable to
that of another Alpha object.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta extends Alpha {
    void modifyVariable(Alpha a) {
        a.iamprivateprotected = this.iamprivateprotected;	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Protected</h4>
<blockquote>
The next access level specifier is protected which allows the class itself,
subclasses (with a caveat), and all classes in the same package to access
the variable.
To declare a protected variable, use the keyword <code>protected</code>.
For example, take this version of the Alpha class which
is now declared to be within a package named "Greek" and which has a
single protected variable declared within it.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Alpha {
    protected int iamprotected;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now, suppose that the class, Beta, was also declared to be a member of
the Greek package. The Beta class can legally access the <code>iamprotected</code>
variable declared within the Alpha class.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprotected = 10;	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name=protectedcaveat>
That's pretty straightforward.</a> Now, let's investigate how subclasses of
Alpha can access protected variables.
<p>
Let's introduce a new class, Gamma, that
derives from Alpha but lives in a different package. The Gamma class can
access the <code>iamprotected</code> variable, but only on objects of type
Gamma or its subclasses. For example, the <code>accessMethod()</code>
of the following class attempts to access the <code>iamprotected</code>
variable on an object of type ProtectedAlpha, which is illegal, and on an object
of type Gamma, which is legal.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Gamma {
    void accessMethod(ProtectedAlpha a) {
        a.iamprotected = 10;    //illegal
        this.iamprotected = 10;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
If a class is both a subclass of and in the same package as the class
with the protected variable, then the class has access to the protected
variable (its package status takes precedence over its subclass status).
</blockquote>

<h4>Public</h4>
<blockquote>
Now for the easiest access specifier--public. To declare a public variable,
use the keyword <code>public</code>. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    public int iampublic;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Any class, in any package, has access to a class's public variables.
For example, this version of the Beta class
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
	Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iampublic = 10;	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
can legally inspect and modify the <code>iampublic</code> variable
in the Alpha class.
</blockquote>

<h4>Friendly</h4>
<blockquote>
And finally, the last access level is what you get if you don't
explicitly set a variable's access to one of the other levels.
For example, this version of the Alpha class declares a single
"friendly" variable and lives within the Greek package.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Alpha {
    int iamfriendly;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The Alpha class has access to <code>iamfriendly</code>. In
addition, all the classes declared within the same package as
Alpha also have access to <code>iamfriendly</code>.
For example, suppose that both Alpha and Beta were declared
as part of the Greek package, then this Beta class
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprotected = 10;	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
could legally access <code>iamfriendly</code>.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
