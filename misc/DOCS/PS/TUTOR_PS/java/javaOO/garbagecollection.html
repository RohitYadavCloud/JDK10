<h2>
    Garbage Collection of unused objects
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Other object-oriented languages require that you keep track of all the objects
you create and that you destroy them when they are no longer needed. Writing
code to manage memory in this way is tedious and often error-prone. Java saves
you from this by allowing you to create as many objects as you want (limited
of course to whatever your system can handle) but never having to destroy them.
The Java runtime environment deletes objects when it determines that they
are no longer being used. This process is known as garbage collection.
<p>
The Java runtime environment supports a garbage collector that periodically
frees the memory used by objects that are no longer needed.
The Java garbage collector is a mark-sweep garbage collector that scans
Java's dynamic memory areas for objects, marking those that are referenced.
After all possible paths to objects are investigated, those objects that are
not marked (i.e. are not referenced) are known to be garbage and are collected.
(A more complete description of our garbage collection algorithm might be "A
compacting, mark-sweep collector with some conservative scanning".)
<p>
The garbage collector runs synchronously when the system runs out of memory, or
in response to a request from a Java program. Your Java program can ask the
garbage collector to run at any time by calling <code>System.gc()</code>.
The garbage collector requires about 20 milliseconds to complete its task
so, your program should only run the garbage collector when there will be no
performance impact and the program anticipates an idle period long enough for
the garbage collector to finish its job.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Asking the garbage collection to run does not guarantee
that your objects will be garbage collected.
<p>
The Java garbage collector runs asynchronously when the system is idle
on systems that allow the Java runtime to note when a thread has begun
and to interrupt another thread (such as Windows 95). As soon as another
thread becomes active, the garbage collector is asked to get to a consistent
state and then terminate.
