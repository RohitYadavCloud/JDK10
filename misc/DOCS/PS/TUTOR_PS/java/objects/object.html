<h2>
    What is an Object?
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As the name implies, <em>objects</em> are the key concept to understanding
object-oriented technology.
You can look around you now and see many examples of real-world objects:
your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.
<p>
These real-world objects share two characteristics: they all have <em>state</em>
and they all have <em>behaviour</em>.  For example, dogs have state (name,
color, breed, hungry) and dogs have behaviour (barking, fetching and slobbering
on your newly cleaned slacks). Bicycles have state (current gear, current pedal
cadence, two wheels, number of gears) and behaviour (braking, accelerating,
slowing down, changing gears).
<p>
Software objects are modelled after real-world objects in that, they too,
have state and behaviour. A software object maintains its state in variables
and implements its behaviour with methods.
<hr>
<strong>Definition: </strong> Objects are software bundles of data
and related methods.
<hr>
Because software objects are modeled after to real-world objects, you can represent
real-world objects in programs using software objects. You might want to represent
dogs in an animation program or a bicycle in an indoor electronic exercise bike.
However, you can also use software objects to "objectify" abstract concepts. For example,
"event" is a common object used in GUI window systems to represent the event when a
user presses a mouse button or strikes a key on the keyboard.
<p>
The following illustration is a common visual representation of a software
object:

<p>
Everything that the software object knows (state) and can do (behaviour)
is expressed by the variables and methods within that object. 
A software object that modelled your real-world bicycle would
have variables that indicated the bicycle's current state: it's moving
at 10 mph, its pedal cadence is 90 rpm, and it's in 5th gear.
<p>

<p>
The software bicycle would also have methods that allowed you to brake,
change the pedal cadence and change gears. (The bike would not have a
method for changing the speed of the bicycle as the bike's speed is really
just a side-effect of what gear you're in, how fast you're pedaling and
how steep the hill is.)

<p>
Anything that an object does not know or can not do is excluded from the
object. For example, your bicycle (probably) doesn't have a name, and it can't run, bark
or fetch. Thus there are no variables or methods for those states and behaviours.
<p>
As you can see from the diagrams, the object's variables make up the center
or nucleus of the object and the methods surround and hide the object's nucleus from
other objects in the program. Packaging an object's variables within the protective
custody of its methods is called <em>encapsulation</em>. Typically, encapsulation
is used to hide unimportant implementation details from other objects.
When you want to change gears on your bicycle, you don't need to know how the
gear mechanism works, you just need to know which lever to move. Thus, the
implementation can change at any time without changing other parts of the program.

<h4>The Benefit of Encapsulation</h4>
<blockquote>
Encapsulating related variables and methods into a neat software bundle is 
a simple yet very powerful idea that provides two primary benefits to
software developers:
<ul>
<li>
Modularity--the source code for an object can be written and maintained
independently of the source code for other objects. Also, an object can
be easily passed around in the system. You can give your bicycle to someone else
and it will still work.
<li>
Information hiding--an object has a public interface which other objects
can use to communicate with it. But the object can maintain private
information and methods that it can change at any time without affecting
the other objects that depend on it. You don't need to understand the gear
mechanism on your bike in order to use it.
</ul>
