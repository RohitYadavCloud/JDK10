<h2>
    Creating Your Own Exception Classes
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

When you design a package of Java classes that collaborate to
provide some useful function to your users, you work hard to
ensure that your classes interact well together and that their
interfaces are easy to understand and program to. You should
spend as much time thinking about and designing the exceptions
that your classes throw as you do thinking about and designing
the classes themselves.
<p>
Suppose you were writing a linked list class that you were
planning to distribute as freeware software.
Among other methods, your linked list class supports these methods:
<dl>
<dt>
<code>objectAt(int n)</code>
<dd>
returns the object in the <code>n</code>th position in the list,
<dt>
<code>firstObject()</code>
<dd>
returns the first object in the list
<dt>
<code>indexOf(Object o)</code>
<dd>
searches the list for the Object specified and returns its
position in the list
</dl>

<h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4>
<blockquote>
Because many programmers would be using your linked list class, you
can be assured that many will misuse or abuse your class and its methods.
Also, some legitimate calls to your linked list's methods may result
in an undefined result. Regardless, in the face of errors, you want your
linked list class to be as robust as possible under the circumstances,
do something reasonable about the error, and communicate errors back to
the calling program. However, you can't anticipate how each user of your
linked list class will want the object to behave under adversity.
So, often the best thing to do is to throw an exception.
<p>
Each of the methods supported by your linked list may wish to throw an
exception under certain conditions, and each method will probably throw
a different type of exception than the others. For example,
<dl>
<dt>
<code>objectAt()</code>
<dd>
will throw a exception if the integer passed into the method is less than
0 or larger than the number of object currently contained in the list
<dt>
<code>firstObject()</code>
<dd>
will throw a exception if the list contains no objects
<dt>
<code>indexOf()</code>
<dd>
will throw a exception if the object passed into the method is
not contained in the list
</dl>
But what type of exception should each method throw? Should it be
an exception provided with the Java development environment? Or should
you roll your own?
</blockquote>

<h4>Choosing the Exception Type to Throw</h4>
<blockquote>
When faced with choosing the type of exception to throw, you have two
choices:
<ol>
<li>
use one written by someone else. For example, the Java development
enviroment provides a lot of exception classes that you could use.
<li>
write one of your own
</ol>

You should go to the trouble of writing your own exception classes
if you answer "yes" to any of the following questions. Otherwise, you
can probably get away with using someone else's:
<ul>
<li>
Do you need an exception type that isn't represented by those in
the Java development environment?
<li>
Would it help your users if they could differentiate your exceptions
from those thrown by classes written by other vendors?
<li>
Does your code throw more than one related exception?
<li>
If you use someone else's exceptions, will your users have access to
those exceptions? A similar question is "Should your package be
independent and self-contained?"
</ul>
<p>
Your linked list class can throw multiple exceptions, and it would
be convenient to be able to catch all exceptions thrown by the linked
list with one handler. Also, if you plan on distributing your linked
list in a package, all related code should be packaged together.
Thus for the linked list, you should roll your own exception class
hierarchy.
<p>
The following diagram illustrates one possible exception class hierarchy
designed to support the linked list as described above:
<p>
<center><img src="images/linklist.trans.gif" width=337 height=167></center>
<p>
LinkedListException is the parent class of all the possible exceptions
that can be thrown by the linked list class. Users of your linked list
class can write a single exception handler to handle all linked list
exceptions with a <code>catch</code> statement like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
catch (LinkedListException) {
    . . . 
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Or, users could write more specialized handlers for each subclass of
LinkedListException.
</blockquote>

<h4>Choosing a Superclass</h4>
<blockquote>
The diagram above does not indicate the superclass of the LinkedListException
class. As you know, Java exceptions must be Throwable objects (they must be
instances of Throwable or a subclass of Throwable). So, your temptation might
be to make LinkedListException a subclass of Throwable. However,
the java.lang package provides two Throwable subclasses that further divide
the type of problems that can occur within a Java program: Errors and
Exceptions. Most of the applets and applications that you write will
throw objects that are Exceptions. (Errors are reserved for serious hard
errors that occur deep in the system.)
<p>
Theoretically, any Exception subclass could be used as the parent
class of LinkedListException. However, a quick perusal of those
classes show that they are either too specialized or completely unrelated
to LinkedListException to be appropriate.
Thus, the parent class of LinkedListException should be Exception.
<p>
Because runtime exceptions don't have to be declared in the throws clause
of a method, many packages developers ask: "Isn't
it just easier if I make all of my exception inherit from RuntimeException?"
The answer to this question is covered in detail
on <a href="runtime.html">Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a>.
The bottom line is that you shouldn't derive from RuntimeException
unless your class really is a runtime exception! For most of you, this
means "No, your exceptions shouldn't inherit from RuntimeException."
</blockquote>

<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
<blockquote>
It's good practice to append the word "Exception" to the end of
all classes that inherit (directly or indirectly) from the
Exception class. Similarly, classes that inherit from the Error
class should end with the string "Error".
