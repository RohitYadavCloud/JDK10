<h2>
    Dealing with Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

<a href=firstencounter.html>Your First Encounter with Java Exceptions</a>
briefly described what your first encounter with Java exceptions was probably
like: it was likely in the form of an error message from the compiler complaining
that you must either catch or declare exceptions. Then,
<a href=catchOrDeclare.html>Java's Catch or Declare Requirement</a> discussed
what exactly was meant by the error message and why the Java language designers
decided to make this requirement. Now, we're going to show you both how to catch
an exception and how to declare one.

<h4><a href=theexample.html>The Example</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Both sections below, the one on catching an exception and the one on declaring
an exception, use the same example. This example defines and implements a
class named <a href=example/ListOfNumbersWOHandler.java>ListOfNumbers</a>.
The ListOfNumbers class calls two methods from classes in the Java packages
that can throw exceptions. <a href=#catching>Catching and Handling Exceptions</a>
will show you how to write exception handlers for both exceptions, and
<a href=#declaring>Declaring the Exceptions Thrown by a Method</a>
will show you how to declare those exceptions instead of catching them.
</blockquote>

<a name=catching>
<h4><a href=handling.html>Catching and Handling Exceptions</a></h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Now that you've familiarized yourself with the ListOfNumbers class and
where the exceptions can be thrown, let's write exception handlers to
catch and handle those exceptions.
<p>
This section covers the three components of an exception handler: the <code>try</code>,
<code>catch</code>, and <code>finally</code> blocks by showing you how to
use them to write an exception handler for the ListOfNumbers class's <code>writeList()</code>
method. In addition, this section contains a page that walks through the
<code>writeList()</code> method and analyzes what occurs within the method
during various scenarios.
</blockquote>

<a name=declaring>
<h4><a href=declaring.html>Declaring the Exceptions Thrown by a Method</a></h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
If it is not appropriate for your method to catch and handle an exception
thrown by a method that it calls, or if your method itself throws its
own exception, you must declare in the method signature that the method
throws the exception.
Using the ListOfNumbers class this section shows you how to declare exceptions.
