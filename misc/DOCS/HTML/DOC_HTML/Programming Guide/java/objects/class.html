<h2>
    What are Classes?
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

In the real world, you often have many objects of the same kind.
For example, your bicycle is really just one of many bicycles
in the world. Using object-oriented terminology, we say that
your bicycle is an <em>instance</em> of the class of objects knowns
as bicycles. All bicycles have some states (current gear, current
cadence, two wheels) and behaviours (change gears, brake) in common.
<p>
When building bicycles, manufacturers take advantage of the fact that
bicycles share characteristics and they build many bicycles
from the same blueprint--it would be very inefficient to produce a new
blueprint for every individual bicycle they manufactured.
<p>
In object-oriented software, it's also possible to have many objects
of the same kind that share characteristics: rectangles, employee
records, video clips and so on. Like the bicycle manufacturers,
you can take advantage of the fact that objects of the same kind
share certain characteristics and you can create a blueprint for those
objects. Software blueprints for objects are called <em>classes</em>.
<hr>
<strong>Definition:</strong> A class is a template or prototype that
defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a
certain kind.

<p>
For example, you could create the bicycle class that would declare
several variables to contain the current gear, the current cadence, etc.
It would also declare and provide implementations for the methods that allow
the rider to change gears, brake and change the pedaling cadence.

<p>
The values for the variables are provided by each instance of the class.
So, after you've created the bicycle class, you must <em>instantiate</em>
it (create an instance of it) to use it. When you create an instance from
a class, the variables declared by the class are allocated in memory.
Then you can use the instance's methods to assign values to the variables.
Instances of the same class share method implementations.

<h4>The Term "Object"</h4>
<blockquote>
You probably noticed that the illustrations of objects and classes look
very similar to one another. And indeed, the differentiation between classes
and objects is often the source of some confusion. In the real world it's obvious
that classes are not themselves the objects that they describe--a blueprint
of a bicycle is not a bicycle. However, it's a little more difficult
to differentiate classes and objects in software. This is partially because software
objects are merely electronic models of real-world objects or abstract concepts in
the first place. But also because many people use the term "object" inconsistently
and use it to refer to both classes and instances.
<p>
In the diagrams, a class's methods and variables are not colored in because
they don't exist yet. You must create an instance from the class before you
can call the methods and before the variables can have any values.
In comparison, an object's methods and variables are filled in with color
indicating that the object actually exists and you can use it. You can send
the object a message and it will respond by performing the method and perhaps
modifying the values of the variables.
</blockquote>

<h4>The Benefit of Classes</h4>
<blockquote>
Objects provide the benefit of modularity and information hiding.
Classes provide the benefit of reusability. Bicycle manufacturers
reuse the same blueprint over and over again to build lots of bicycles.
Software programmers use the same class over and over to again create
many objects.
