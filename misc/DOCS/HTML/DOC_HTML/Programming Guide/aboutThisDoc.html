     About this Tutorial
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

<strong>The Java Language Tutorial</strong> is a practical,
on-line guide to writing programs in the Java language.
Java programs can be standalone applications,
or they can execute within a Java-enabled browser such as HotJava.

<!--    ORGANIZATION   -->
<h4>Documentation Trails</h4>
<blockquote>
This tutorial consists of a series of intersecting <em>trails</em>--programming
lessons grouped together based on topic. To learn about a certain area of Java
programming, go to the
<a href=index.html><em>Trail Map</em></a>
<a href=index.html><img src=images/WayUpArrow.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
and decide which trail is of interest to you and follow the link to the <em>trail
head</em> for that trail. For example, if you are interested in information about
writing applets, select the link to the <em>Writing Applets</em> trail, marked
with this signpost.

<p>
The trail head is the first page on a trail and it lists, describes, and provides
links to all of the lessons on the trail. Selecting a link from the trail head takes
you to the <em>lesson head</em> for the lesson that you chose. The lesson head 
is the first page in the lesson and introduces the lesson,
and typically provides an outline or overview of the lesson. Usually, several
<em>lesson pages</em> comprise the entire lesson.

<h4>The Control Panel</h4>
<blockquote>
Each page in <strong>The Java Language Tutorial</strong> has a control panel at
the top with the following five elements:

<p>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/PreviousArrow.gif width=26 height=26 align=left border=0></a>
The "Previous" link which takes you to the previous page in the lesson.<br>

<p>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/NextArrow.gif width=26 height=26 align=left border=0></a>
The "Next" link which takes you to the next page in the lesson.<br>

<p>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/WayUpArrow.gif width=26 height=26 align=left border=0></a>
This link transports you to the top of the tutorial: to the <em>Trail Map</em>.

<p>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/uiHeader.gif width=26 height=26 align=left border=0></a>
This is a trail marker and is a link to the trail head of the current trail.
Each trail has its own identifying <em>trail marker</em>--the symbol
shown here is represents the <em>Creating a User Interface</em> trail.

<p>
<a href=MissingPage.html><strong><em>Lesson Title</em></strong></a>
And finally, this right-aligned (supposedly) link is the title of the current lesson
and is linked to the lesson head (the first page in the lesson) of the current lesson.

<h4>In-Line Links</h4>
<blockquote>
Links within the text of the tutorial have one of the
following forms:
</blockquote>
<ul>

<li>
Links to pages within the current lesson are <a href=MissingPage.html>text links</a>.

<li>
Links to pages within a different lesson, but on the same trail as the current lesson are
<a href=MissingPage.html>also text links</a>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/getStartedIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
but they have an icon that indicates which trail the lesson is on. Both the text and the icon are links.

<li>
Links to pages in a different trail are
<a href=MissingPage.html>also text links</a>
<a href=MissingPage.html><img src=images/getStartedIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
but they have an icon that indicates which trail the lesson is on. Both the text and the icon are links.
</ul>
