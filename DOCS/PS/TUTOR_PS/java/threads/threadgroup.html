<h2>
    The ThreadGroup Class
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

In Java, all threads must be a member of a <em>thread group</em>.
Thread groups provide a mechanism for collecting multiple threads
together into a single object and manipulating those threads all at
once through the group rather than individually through the threads
themselves. For example, you can start or suspend all the threads
within a group with a single method call. Java thread groups are
implemented by the ThreadGroup class in the java.lang package.
<p>
ThreadGroups can contain any number of threads and can contain
any number of ThreadGroups. The result is a root-like hierarchy of
threads and thread groups.

<h4>List Management Methods</h4>
<blockquote>
The ThreadGroup class is similar to other collection objects in
that it provides a set of methods that manage the list of threads
within the group and allow other objects to query for information
about the list. For example, you can call ThreadGroup's
<code>activeCount()</code> method to find out the number of threads
currently within the group. In addition, you can <code>enumerate()</code>
all the threads within the group and all the other thread groups within
the group.
<p>
Other list management methods provided by the ThreadGroup class include
<code>activeGroupCount</code> and <code>list()</code>.
</blockquote>

<h4>Methods that Operate on the Group</h4>
<blockquote>
The ThreadGroup class supports several attributes that are set and
retrieved from the group as a whole. These attributes include the
maximum priority that any thread within the group can have, whether
or not the group is group of daemon threads, the name of the group,
and the parent of the group.
<p>
The methods that get and set ThreadGroup attributes operate at the
group level. That is, they inspect or change the attribute on the
ThreadGroup object, but do not affect any of the threads within the
group.  The following is a list of ThreadGroup methods that operate
at the group level:
<ul>
<li>
<code>getMaxPriority()</code>, <code>setMaxPriority()</code>
<li>
<code>getDaemon()</code>, <code>setDaemon()</code>
<li>
<code>getName()</code>
<li>
<code>getParent()</code>, <code>parentOf()</code>
<li>
<code>toString()</code>
</ul>
So, for example, when you use <code>setMaxPriority()</code> to change
a group's maximum priority, you are only changing the attribute on the
group object; you are not changing the priority of any of the threads
within the group. Consider this small program that creates a group and
a thread within that group:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class PriorityTest {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
	Thread t1 = new RandomPrintString(&quot;Duke&quot;);
        Thread t2 = new RandomPrintString(&quot;Of Earl&quot;);
        Thread t3 = new RandomPrintString(&quot;Whatcha doin'?&quot;);

	t1.setPriority(4);
	t2.setPriority(5);
	t3.setPriority(6);

	t1.start();
	t2.start();
	t3.start();
    }
}

class RandomPrintString extends Thread {
    public RandomPrintString(String str) {
	super(str);
    }
    public void run() {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
	    System.out.println(getName());
	    //sleep((int)(Math.random() * 1000));
	}
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
When the ThreadGroup is created it inherits its maximum priority
attribute from its parent thread group (which in this case is the
maximum allowed by the Java runtime system (10)).
Next the program sets the thread's priority to the maximum allowed
by the Java runtime system, and then lowers the group's maximum to
the "normal" priority (5). The <code>setMaxPriority()</code> method
does not affect the priority of the <code>max</code> thread, so that
at this point, the <code>max</code> thread has a priority of 10 which
is greater than the maximum priority of its group <code>norm</code>.
This is the output from the program:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Group's maximum priority = 5
Thread's priority = 10
</pre>
</blockquote>
So, you can see that it is possible for a thread to have a higher
priority than the maximum allowed by its group.
A thread group's maximum priority is used to limit a thread's priority
when the thread is first created within a group and when you use
<code>setPriority()</code> to change it. Note that <code>setMaxPriority()</code>
does change the maximum priority of all of its sub-threadgroups.
<p>
Similarly, a group's name and daemon status applies only to the group.
Changing the group's name or daemon status does not affect the name
or daemon status of any of its threads. Furthermore, a group's daemon
status does not in any way imply the daemon status of its threads--you
can put any thread within a daemon thread group. The daemon status of
a thread group simply determines when the group will be destroyed.
</blockquote>

<h4>Methods that Operate on All Threads within a Group</h4>
<blockquote>
The ThreadGroup class supports several methods that allow you to
modify the current state of all the threads within that group:
<ul>
<li>
<code>resume()</code>
<li>
<code>stop()</code>
<li>
<code>suspend()</code>
</ul>
These methods apply the appropriate state change to every thread
in the thread group and to every thread sub-group in the thread
group.
</blockquote>

<h4>Access Restrictions</h4>
<blockquote>
The ThreadGroup class itself does not
impose any access restrictions (such as allowing threads from one
group to inspect or modify threads in a different group) on thread
groups. Rather the ThreadGroup class supports the security manager
(a subclass of the java.lang.SecurityManager class) in its effort
to impose access restrictions based on thread group membership.

<p>
The ThreadGroup checks with the current security manager, through a call
to its <code>checkAccess()</code> method, when any "regulated"
access is attempted to see if the access should be allowed. The security manager
decides whether or not to allow the access based on the group membership of the
threads involved. If access is not allowed, the <code>checkAccess()</code>
methods throws a SecurityException. Otherwise, <code>checkAccess()</code>
just returns. The following is a list of ThreadGroup
methods that call <code>checkAccess()</code> before performing the action
of the method. These are what are known as <em>regulated accesses</em>, that
is, accesses that must be approved by the security manager before they can be
completed.
<ul>
<li>
creation of a new ThreadGroup with the constructor
<code>ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parent, String name)</code>
<li>
<code>setDaemon()</code>
<li>
<code>setMaxPriority()</code>
<li>
<code>stop()</code>
<li>
<code>suspend()</code>
<li>
<code>resume()</code>
<li>
<code>destroy()</code>
</ul>
By default, when you write a stand-alone Java application you get a generic
security manager that imposes no access restrictions and allows any thread
to inspect or modify any other thread regardless of the groups they are in.
You can define and implement your own access restrictions for thread
groups by subclassing SecurityManager, overriding the appropriate
methods, and then installing your security manager as the current security
manager in your application.

<p>
The HotJava Web browser is an example of an application that implements
its own security manager. HotJava needs to ensure that applets are
well-behaved and don't do nasty things (such as lowering the priority
of another applet's threads) to other applets running at the same time.
HotJava's security manager does not allow threads in different groups
to modify one another. Please note that access restrictions based on
thread groups may vary from browser to browser and thus applets
may behave differently in different browsers. For more information
about access restrictions on thread groups within applets, see
