<h2>
    Thread Group
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

In Java, all threads must be a member of a <em>thread group</em>.
Thread groups provide a mechanism for collecting multiple threads
together into a single object and manipulating those threads all at
once through the group rather than individually through the threads
themselves. For example, you can start or suspend all the threads
within a group with a single method call. Java thread groups are
implemented by the ThreadGroup class in the java.lang package.

<h4>Creating a Thread Explicitly within a Group</h4>
<blockquote>
The only time that you are allowed to set a thread's group is during
creation--a thread can't be moved to a new group after it's been created.
Thus, you should specify a thread's group explicitly when you create it.
The Thread class has three different constructors that let you set the
new thread's group:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable)</code>
<li>
<code>Thread(ThreadGroup, String)</code>
<li>
<code>Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)</code>
</ul>
Each of these constructors requires a ThreadGroup as its first parameter,
creates a new thread, initializes it based on the other parameters, and
makes the new thread a member of the specified group. For example, the following
code sample creates a ThreadGroup named <code>myThreadGroup</code> and then
creates a thread called <code>myThread</code> in that group.
<blockquote>
<pre>
ThreadGroup myThreadGroup = new ThreadGroup("My Group of Threads");
Thread myThread = new Thread(myThreadGroup, "a thread for my group");
</pre>
</blockquote>
The ThreadGroup passed into a Thread constructor does not necessarily have
to be a group that you created--it could be a group that was created by the
Java runtime system, or a group that was created by the application in which
your applet is running.

<p>
As you know, you don't have to set the thread group when you create a new
thread--the Thread class supports several constructors that don't require
a ThreadGroup argument. If you don't explicitly set the thread group for a
new thread when you create it (which is probably what you've been doing until
now), the new thread is automatically placed in the same group as the thread
which created it (known as the <em>current thread</em> and the <em>current
thread group</em> respectively).

<p>
So, if all threads must be in a group, and you haven't created a ThreadGroup,
and you create a new thread without specifying its group, what is the thread's group?
When an application first starts up, the Java runtime system creates
a ThreadGroup named "main". So, unless specified otherwise, all new
threads that you create become members of the "main" thread group.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> if the thread that you are creating is created by an applet,
it's possible that the new thread's group will be something other than
"main". It depends on the browser or viewer that the applet is running in.
</blockquote>

<h4>Getting a Thread's Group</h4>
<blockquote>
To find out what group a thread is in, you can call its <code>getThreadGroup()</code>
method.
<blockquote>
<pre>
theGroup = myThread.getThreadGroup();
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=threadgroup.html>The ThreadGroup Class</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Once you've obtained a thread's ThreadGroup, you can query the
group for information (such as what other threads are in the group),
or you can modify the threads in that group (such as suspend,
resume or stop them) with a single method call.
