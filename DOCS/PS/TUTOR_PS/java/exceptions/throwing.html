<h2>
    How to Throw Exceptions
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The pages listed below explain how to throw exceptions in
a Java program.

<h4><a href=throw.html>The throw Statement</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Before you can catch an exception, some Java code somewhere must
throw one. Any Java code can throw an exception: your code, code
from a package written by someone else (such as the packages that
come with the Java development environment), or the Java runtime
system. Regardless of who (or what) throws the exception, it's
always thrown with the Java <code>throw</code> statement.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=throwable.html>The Throwable Class and Its Subclasses</a></h4>
<blockquote>
The Java language requires that all objects you throw with the
<code>throw</code> statement derive from the Throwable class or one
of its subclasses.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=creating.html>Creating Your Own Exception Classes</a></h4>
<blockquote>
As you have undoubtedly noticed in your travels (travails?) through the
Java language, the packages that ship with the Java development environment
provide numerous error and exception classes. All of these classes are
descendents of the Throwable class and allow programs to differentiate
between the various types of errors or exceptions that can occur during
the execution of a Java program.
<p>
You, as a Java programmer, can create your own error and exception classes
as well to create a set of classes that represents problems
that can occur within the classes that you write. Indeed, if you are a package
developer you will find that you must create their own set of exceptions
classes to allow your users to differentiate an error that can occur
in your package versus those errors that occur in the Java development
environment or other packages.
