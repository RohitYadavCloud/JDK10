<h2>
    Java's Catch or Declare Requirement
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As stated previously, Java requires that methods either catch or
declare all non-runtime exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of
that method. This requirement has several components
that need further description: "catch", "declare", "non-runtime exceptions",
and "the exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method".

<h4>Catch</h4>
<blockquote>
A method can catch an exception by providing an exception handler for
that type of exception. The next page, <a href=dealing.html>Dealing with Exceptions</a>,
introduces an example program, talks about catching exceptions, and shows you how
to write an exception handler for the example program.
</blockquote>

<h4>Declare</h4>
<blockquote>
If a method chooses not to catch an exception, then the method must
declare that it can throw it. Why did the Java designers make this requirement?
Because any exception that can be thrown by a method is really part of
the method's public programming interface: callers of a method must know
about the exceptions that a method can throw in order to intelligently
and conciously decide what to do about those exceptions. Thus, you
declare the exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of a Java
methods in the method signature.
<p>
The next page, <a href=dealing.html>Dealing with Exceptions</a>,
talks about declaring exceptions and shows you how to declare
exceptions for Java methods that require it.
</blockquote>

<h4>Non-runtime Exceptions</h4>
<blockquote>
In Java, there are different types of exceptions, including I/O Exceptions, 
runtime exceptions and exceptions of your own creation to name a few.
Of interest to us in this discussion are runtime exceptions. Runtime
exceptions are those exceptions that occur within the Java runtime system.
This includes arithmetic exceptions, such as when dividing by zero, pointer
exceptions, such as trying to access an object through a null reference,
and indexing exceptions, such as attempting to access an array element
through an index that is too large or too small.
<p>
Runtime exceptions can occur anywhere in a program and in a typical
program can be very numerous. Often the cost of checking for runtime exceptions
exceeds the benefit of catching or declaring them. Thus the compiler
does not require that you catch or declare runtime exceptions, though
you can.
<p>
Often, this is considered a loophole in Java's exception handling mechanism
and programmer's are tempted to declare all exceptions to be runtime exceptions.
In general, this is not recommended.
<a href=runtime.html>Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a> contains a thorough
discussion about when and how to use runtime exceptions.
</blockquote>

<h4>The exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method</h4>
<blockquote>
The statement <em>exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method</em>
may seem obvious at first: just look for the <code>throw</code> statement.
However, this statement includes more than just the exceptions that can be thrown
directly by the method: the key is in the phrase <em>within the scope of</em>.
This phrase includes any exception that can be thrown while the flow of control
remains within the method. Thus, this statement includes both
<ul>
<li>
exceptions that are thrown directly by the method with Java's <code>throw</code>
statement, and
<li>
exceptions that are thrown indirectly by the method through calls to other
methods
</ul>
