    Putting It All Together

<blockquote>

When all of the components are put togehter, the <code>writeList()</code>
method will look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void writeList() {
    PrintStream pStr = null;

    try {
        int i;

        System.err.println("Entering try statement");
        pStr = new PrintStream(
              new BufferedOutputStream(
                 new FileOutputStream("OutFile.txt")));

        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
            pStr.println("Value at: " + i + " = " + victor.elementAt(i));
    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        System.err.println("Caught ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println("Caught IOException: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        if (pStr != null) {
            System.err.println("Closing PrintStream");
            pStr.close();
        } else {
            System.err.println("PrintStream not open");
        }
    }
}  
</pre>
</blockquote>
This <code>try</code> block in this method has three different exit possibilities:
<ol>
<li>
The <code>new FileOutputStream</code> statement fails and throws an IOException.
<li>
The <code>victor.elementAt(i)</code> statement fails and throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
<li>
Everything succeeds and the <code>try</code> statement exits normally.
</ol>
This page investigates in
detail what happens in the <code>writeList()</code> method during
each of those exit possibilities.

<h4>Scenario 1: An IOException Occurs</h4>
<blockquote>
The <code>new FileOutputStream("OutFile.txt")</code> statement can fail for
any number of reasons: the user doesn't have write permission on the file or
directory, the file system is full, or the directory for the file doesn't exist.
If any of these situations is true, then the constructor for FileOutputStream
throws an IOException.
<p>
When the IOException is thrown, the runtime system immediately stops execution
of the <code>try</code> block. Then the runtime system attempts to locate an
exception handler appropriate for handling an IOException.
<p>
The runtime system immediately takes over and tries to locate
an appropriate exception handler. The runtime system begins its search at
the top of the method call stack. When the exception occurred, the FileOutputStream
constructor was at the top of the call stack. However, the FileOutputStream
constructor doesn't have an appropriate exception handler so the runtime system
checks the next method in the method call stack--the <code>writeList()</code>
method. The <code>writeList()</code> method has two exception handlers:
one for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and one for IOException.
<p>
The runtime system checks <code>writeList</code>'s handlers in the order that
they appear following the <code>try</code> statement.
The argument to the first exception handler is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
but the exception that was thrown is an IOException. An IOException cannot legally
be assigned to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, so the runtime system continues
its search for an appropriate exception handler.
<p>
The argument to <code>writeList()</code>'s second exception handler is an
IOException. The exception thrown by the FileOutputStream constructor
is also an IOException and can be legally assigned to the handler's IOException
argument. Thus, this handler is deemed appropriate and the runtime system
executes this handler which prints this statement:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Caught IOException: OutFile.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the exception handler has run, the runtime system passes control to the
<code>finally</code> block. In this particular scenario, the PrintStream never
got opened, thus <code>pStr</code> is null and won't get closed.
After the <code>finally</code> block has completed executing, the program
continues with the first statement after the <code>finally</code> block.
<p>
The complete output that you will see from the ListOfNumbers program when an IOException
is thrown is this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Entering try statement
Caught IOException: OutFile.txt
PrintStream not open
</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4>Scenario 2: An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Occurs</h4>
<blockquote>
This scenario is the same as the first except that a different error occurs
during the <code>try</code> block. In this scenario, the argument passed to
Vector's <code>elementAt()</code> method is out of bounds. That is, the
argument is either less than 0 or is larger than the size of the array.
(The way the code is written, this is actually impossible, but let's suppose
a bug is introduced into the code when someone modifies it.)
<p>
Similar to scenario 1, when the exception occurs the runtime system stops
execution of the <code>try</code> block and attempts to locate an exception
handler suitable for an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The runtime system
searches for an appropriate exception handler as it did before and comes
upon the <code>catch</code> statement in the <code>writeList()</code> method
that handles exceptions of the type ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and executes it.
<p>
After the exception handler has run, the runtime system passes control to the
<code>finally</code> block. In this particular scenario, the PrintStream did get
opened, thus the <code>finally</code> statement closes it.
After the <code>finally</code> block has completed executing, the program
continues with the first statement after the <code>finally</code> block.
<p>
The complete output that you will see from the ListOfNumbers program when an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown is this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Entering try statement
Caught ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10 >= 10
Closing PrintStream
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Scenario 3: The try block exits normally</h4>
<blockquote>
In this scenario, all the statements within the scope of the <code>try</code>
block execute successfully and throw no exceptions. Execution falls off the
end of the <code>try</code> block and then the runtime system passes control to
the <code>finally</code> block. Since everything was successful, we know that
the PrintStream is open when control reaches the <code>finally</code> block
and must be closed.
Again, after the <code>finally</code> block has completed executing, the program
continues with the first statement after the <code>finally</code> block.
<p>
Thus, the output that you will see from the ListOfNumbers program when
no exceptions are thrown is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Entering try statement
Closing PrintStream
</pre>
</blockquote>
