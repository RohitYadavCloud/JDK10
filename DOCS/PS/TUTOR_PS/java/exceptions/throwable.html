<h2>
    The Throwable Class and Its Subclasses
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As you learned on the previous page, you can only throw objects that derive
from the Throwable class. This includes direct descendents (that is, objects
that derive directly from the Throwable class) as well as indirect descendents
(objects that derive from children or grandchildren of the Throwable class).

<p>
This diagram illustrates the class hierarchy of the Throwable class and its
significant subclasses.
<p>
<img src="images/throwableHierarchy.trans.gif" width=495 height=258>
<p>
As you can see from the diagram, Throwable has two direct descendants:
Error and Exception.

<h4>Errors</h4>
<blockquote>
When a dynamic linking failure or some other "hard"
failure in the virtual machine occurs, the virtual
machine throws an Error. Typical Java programs
should not catch Errors. In addition, it's unlikely that
typical Java programs will ever throw Errors either.
</blockquote>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<blockquote>
Most programs throw and catch objects that derive from the
Exception class. Exceptions indicate that a problem occurred
but that problem is not a serious systemic problem. Most programs
you write will throw and catch Exceptions.
<p>
The Exception class has many descendents defined in the Java packages
which indicate various types of exceptions that can occur.
For example, IllegalAccessException signals that a particular method
coult not be found, and InstantiationException indicates that a program
attempted to instantiate an abstract class or an interface.
<p>
One Exception subclass has special meaning in the Java language and
deserves mention here: RuntimeException.
</blockquote>

<a name=RuntimeExceptions>
<h4>RuntimeExceptions</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
The RuntimeException class represents exceptions that occur within the Java
virtual machine (during runtime). An example of a runtime exception is
NullPointerException which occurs when a method tries to access a member
of an object through a null reference. A NullPointerException can occur anywhere
a program tries to dereference a reference to an object, and the cost of checking
for the exception often outweighs the benefit of catching it.
<p>
Because runtime exceptions are so ubiquitous and attempting to catch or
declare all of them all the time would be a fruitless exercise and a
fruitful source of unreadable and unmaintainable code, the compiler allows
runtime exceptions to go uncaught and undeclared.
<p>
The Java packages define several RuntimeException classes. You can
catch these exceptions just like other exceptions. However, a method is not
required to declare that it throws RuntimeExceptions. In addition, you
can create your own RuntimeException subclasses.
<a href=runtime.html>Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a> contains a thorough
discussion about when and how to use runtime exceptions.
