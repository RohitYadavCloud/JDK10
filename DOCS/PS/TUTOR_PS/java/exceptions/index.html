<h1>
     Handling Errors using Exceptions
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

If there's one golden rule of programming, it's this: errors occur in
software programs. This we know. But what really matters is what
happens after the error occurs. How is the error handled? Who handles
it? Can the program recover?
<p>
The Java language uses <em>exceptions</em> to provide
error handling capabilities for its programs. In this lesson you will
learn what an exception is, how to throw and catch exceptions, what to
do with an exception once you've caught it, and how to best use the
exception class hierarchy provided by the Java development environment.
<p>
<strong>Note on terminology:</strong> Some languages (or their development
environments) use the terms <em>raise</em> and <em>handle</em> the same way
that Java uses <em>throw</em> and <em>catch</em>. Java inherits its
terminology and much of its exception syntax from C++.

<h4><a href=definition.html>What's an Exception and Why Do I Care?</a></h4>
<blockquote>
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program
that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=firstencounter.html>Your First Encounter with Java Exceptions</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Now that you understand what exceptions are and the advantages of using
exceptions in your Java programs, let's start writing some Java code to
put exceptions to use.
<p>
If you have done any amount of Java programming
at all, you have undoubtedly seen an error message similar to this one:
<blockquote>
<pre>
FileWithGetLine.java:8: Warning: Exception java.io.FileNotFoundException must be caught, or it must be declared in throws clause of this method.
	fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
	      ^
</pre>
</blockquote>
This message indicates that the compiler found an exception that is not being
dealt with. The Java language requires that all non-runtime exceptions be caught
or declared. At first, this may seem overburdensome to you, however, there
are advantages to this requirement.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=catchOrDeclare.html>Java's Catch or Declare Requirement</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Java requires that your programs either catch or declare all non-runtime
exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of that method.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=dealing.html>Dealing with Exceptions</a></h4>
<blockquote>
This page introduces an example that we will use to show you how to catch
an exception and handle it, and alternatively, how to declare an exception
that can be thrown within a method.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=throwing.html>Throwing Exceptions</a></h4>
<blockquote>
So far, you've been catching exceptions thrown by the Java runtime system
or classes from the Java packages. This section shows you how you can throw
exceptions from your own Java code using the <code>throw</code> statement. All
exceptions must be <em>Throwable</em>, that is, exceptions must inherit
(either directly or indirectly) from the Throwable class defined in the
java.lang package.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=runtime.html>Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a></h4>
<blockquote>
Because the Java language does not require methods to catch or declare
runtime exceptions, it's tempting for programmers to
write code that always throw runtime exceptions, or
make all of their exception subclasses inherit from RuntimeException.
Both of these are "exception abuse" and are not recommended.
</blockquote>

<hr>
<strong>Note to C++ Programmers:</strong>
Java exception handlers can have a finally block
which allows programs to cleanup after the <code>try</code> block.
See <a href="finally.html">The finally Block</a> for more information
about how to use the <code>finally</code> statement.
