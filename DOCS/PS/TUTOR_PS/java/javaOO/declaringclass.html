<h2>
    Declaring a Class
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

In general, a class declaration look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
[ <em>modifiers</em> ] class <em>ClassName</em> [ extends <em>SuperClassName</em> ] [ implements <em>InterfaceNames</em> ] {
    . . .
    class body
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The items between [ and ] are optional. A class declaration defines the
following aspects of the class:
<ul>
<li>
<em>modifiers</em> declares whether or not the class is abstract, final or public
<li>
<em>ClassName</em> sets the name of the class you are declaring
<li>
<em>SuperClassName</em> is the name of <em>ClassName</em>'s superclass
<li>
<em>InterfaceNames</em> is a list of all of the interfaces implemented by
the <em>ClassName</em>
</ul>
Of the items in a class declaration, only the <code>class</code> keyword
and the class name are required. The others are optional. If you do not make
an explicit declaration for the optional items, the Java compiler assumes
certain defaults.
<p>
The class name must be a valid Java identifier (that is, it must be a string
of letters that begins with a Unicode letter, that contains only Unicode
letters and digits, and that is not the same as any Java keyword).
By convention, class names begin with a capital letter.
<p>
So, the most simple class declaration you can write would look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class ImaginaryNumber {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
This snippet of code simply declares a class named <code>ImaginaryNumber</code>.
When you declare a class like this, the compiler assumes the following:
<ul>
<li>
the Object class is the super class of <code>ImaginaryNumber</code>
<li>
<code>ImaginaryNumber</code> implements <strong>no</strong> interfaces
<li>
<code>ImaginaryNumber</code> is <strong>not</strong> abstract, <strong>not</strong>
final, and is <strong>not</strong> public.
</ul>
So what does all of this mean? The following sections will shed some light
on it for you.

<h4>Superclasses</h4>
<blockquote>
The Object class sits at the top of the class hierarchy tree in the
Java development environment. Every class, whether written by you, by
the Java development team, or by someone else, in the Java system is a
descendent (whether direct or indirect) of the Object class. The Object
class defines the basic state and behaviours that all objects must have
such as the ability to compare oneself to another object, to convert to
a string, to wait on a condition variable, to notify other objects that
a condition variable has changed, and to return the object's class. For
more information about the Object class, see <a href="../../MissingPage.html">missing page</a>.
<p>
In Java, every class must have a superclass. If you do not specify a 
superclass for your class, it is assumed to be the Object class.
To specify an object's superclass explicitly, put the keyword <code>extends</code>
followed by the superclass name directly after the name of the class that
you are declaring. So this class declaration
<blockquote>
<pre>
class ImaginaryNumber extends Number {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
explicitly declares that the Number class is the superclass of the
<code>ImaginaryNumber</code> class. (The Number class is part of the java.lang
package and is the base class for Integers, Floats and other numbers.)
</blockquote>

<h4>Interfaces</h4>
<blockquote>
When declaring a class, you can specify which, if any, <em>interfaces</em>
that the class implements. So, what's an interface? An interface declares
a set of methods and constants without specifying the implementation for
any of the methods. When a class claims to implement an interface, it's
claiming to provide implementations for all of the methods declared in the
interface.
<p>
To declare that your class implements an interface, use the keyword
<code>implements</code> followed by the interface. The <code>implements</code>
clause follows the <code>extends</code> clause if there is one. If there is
no <code>extends</code> clause, then the <code>implements</code> clause
follows the class name. The <code>implements</code> clause is optional.
<p>
For example, imagine an interface named Arithmetic that defines methods
named <code>add()</code>, <code>subtract()</code> and so on. Our ImaginaryNumber
class can declare that it implements the Arithmetic interface, thereby
guaranteeing that it provides implemenations for the <code>add()</code>,
<code>subtract()</code> and other methods declared by the Arithmetic
interface.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class ImaginaryNumber extends Number implements Arithmetic {
    . . .
    public Number add(Number) {
	. . .
    }
    public Number subtract(Number) {
	. . .
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that the method signatures of the methods declared in the Arithmetic
interface and the method signatures of the methods implemented in the
ImaginaryNumber class <em>must match</em>!
[PENDING: is the above true even for access specifiers?]
[PENDING: what are the access specifiers for methods defined in an
interface].
</blockquote>

<h4>Abstract Classes</h4>
<blockquote>
To be somewhat circular, an abstract class is a class that has at
least one abstract method in it. Well, that's not a very useful definition, is it?
What's an abstract method? An abstract method is a method that has no
implementation. The intent is to allow parent classes to leave some
methods unimplemented but still require that subclasses (that are not
also abstract) provide implementations for those methods.
<p>
Use an abstract class when your parent class knows that all of its subclasses
will implement a certain method but each subclass will implement it
differently. In other words, there is no default implementation that
will satisfy any of the subclasses. For example, in a drawing application
Rectangle, Triangle and other GraphicObject classes all implement the
<code>draw()</code> method, but implement it differently; there is no
appropriate default implementation for the <code>draw()</code> method.
For more detailed information about abstract classes, see
<a href="../../MissingPage.html">missing page</a>.
<p>
To specify that your class is an abstract class, use the keyword
<code>abstract</code> in the "modifiers clause" that appears
before the <code>class</code> keyword.
<blockquote>
<pre>
abstract class GraphicObject {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The compiler will print an error message if there are no abstract methods
in a class you declare to be abstract.
</blockquote>

<h4>Final Classes</h4>
<blockquote>
You can declare a class to be final; a final class can have no subclasses.
You would a class final to guarantee that other objects and methods using
your class got exactly what they asked for. For example, the String class
in the java.lang package is a final class. The Java system must guarantee
that whenever a method or objects uses a String
they get exactly a java.lang.String and not some string that is a really
a subclass of java.lang.String. This ensures that the object in question
has no strange, inconsistent, or unpredictable properties.
<p>
To specify that your class is a final class, use the keyword
<code>final</code> in the "modifiers clause" that appears
before the <code>class</code> keyword.
For example, if you wanted to make the ImaginaryNumber class a final
class, its declaration would look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
final class ImaginaryNumber extends Number implements Arithmetic {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that it doesn't make sense for a class to be both final and abstract.
In other words, a class that contains declared-but-unimplemented methods
cannot be final. Attempting to declare a class as both final and abstract
results in a compile-time error.
</blockquote>

<h4>Public Classes</h4>
<blockquote>
The last modifier that you can use in a class declaration is the
<code>public</code> modifier. Use <code>public</code> to declare
that the class can be used by objects outside the current package.
By default classes can only be used within the package in which they
are declared.
<p>
For example, the ImaginaryNumber class should be declared public because
we want other classes and objects to have access to this class. Thus
the class declaration for the ImaginaryNumber class now looks like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public final class ImaginaryNumber extends Number implements Arithmetic {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
By convention, when you use the <code>public</code> keyword in a class
declaration, you should make it the very first item in a class declaration
preceding either <code>final</code> or <code>abstract</code> if one of them
is also being used.
