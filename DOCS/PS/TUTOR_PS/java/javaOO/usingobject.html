<h2>
    Using an Object
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Once you've created an object, you will very likely want to use it for
something. Suppose, for example, that in the user of your drawing application
clicked the mouse over the rectangle and dragged it to a new location.
Your drawing application should keep pace and update the x, y position of
the memory representation of the on-screen rectangle.
<p>
The Rectangle class provides two equivalent ways to do this:
<ol>
<li>
call the <code>move()</code> method
<li>
manipulate the object's x, y variables directly
</ol>
Option 1 is often considered "more object-oriented" and safer because you
manipulate the object's variables indirectly through its protective layer
of methods rather than twiddling directly with its variables. Manipulating
an object's variables directly is often considered error-prone; you could
potentially put the object into an inconsistent state. However, a
class would not make its variables available for direct manipulation by other
objects if it were possible for those manipulations to put the object in
an inconsistent state. So, we can assume that manipulating a Rectangle's x
and y variables directly is as safe as calling its <code>move()</code>method.
<p>
A class can restrict or allow access to its instances' variables and methods
by other objects. The following two sections discuss calling methods and
manipulating variables that have been made accessible to other objects. To
learn more about specifying access to an class's methods and variables
refer to <a href="../../MissingPage.html">Missing Page</a>.

<a name=methods>
<h4>Calling an Object's Method</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
First, let's focus on calling the rectangle's <code>move()</code> method.
The next section will show you how to manipulate the Rectangle's x and y
variables directly.
<p>
<a name=objectreference>
To call an object's method,</a> simply append the method name to an object
reference with an intervening '.' (period), and provide any arguments to the method
within enclosing parentheses. If the method does not require any arguments,
just use empty parentheses.
<blockquote>
<pre>
object.method(<em>argumentList</em>);
   <em>or</em>
object.method();
</pre>
</blockquote>
Back to the drawing application, if the user moved the rectangle named
<code>rect</code> to a new location, say 244, 47, the call to <code>rect</code>'s
<code>move()</code> method would look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
rect.move(244, 47);
</pre>
</blockquote>
This Java statement calls <code>rect</code>'s <code>move()</code> method
with two integer parameters, 244 and 47. This statement has the effect 
of moving the <code>rect</code> object to the x, y location 244, 47.
If you wanted to move a different rectangle, named <code>bob</code> for
example, to a new location you would write:
<blockquote>
<pre>
bob.move(244, 47);
</pre>
</blockquote>
As you see from these examples, method calls are directed at a specific
object; the object specified in the method call is the object that responds
to the instruction. Method calls are also called <em>messages</em>. Just
like real-world messages, object messages must be addressed to a particular
recipient. You get different results depending on which object is the recipient
of the message. In the example above, when you send the object named <code>rect</code>
a <code>move</code> message, <code>rect</code> moves to the new location.
When you send the object named <code>bob</code> a <code>move</code> message,
<code>bob</code> moves. Very different results.
<p>
Like other Java statements, a method call is an expression and evaluates
to some value. The value of a method call is its return value, if it has
one. You will often wish to assign the return value of a method to a variable
or use the method call within the scope of another expression or statement. The
<code>move()</code> method doesn't return a value (it's declared void). However,
Rectangle's <code>inside()</code> method does. The <code>inside()</code> method
takes an x, y coordinate and returns true if that point lies within the rectangle.
So you could use the <code>inside()</code> method to determine if some point, say
the current mouse location, was inside the rectangle and do something special
if it were.
<blockquote>
<pre>
if (rect.inside(mouse.x, mouse.y)) {	// mouse is in the rectangle
    . . .
} else {				// mouse is outside of the rectangle
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Remember that the method call is like a message to the object named. In this
case, the object named is the Rectangle named <code>rect</code>. Thus,
<blockquote>
<pre>
rect.inside(mouse.x, mouse.y)
</pre>
</blockquote>
is asking <code>rect</code> if the mouse cursor location represented by
<code>mouse.x</code> and <code>mouse.y</code> is contained within it. You would
likely get a different response if you sent the same message to <code>bob</code>.
<p>
As stated <a href="#objectreference">previously</a>, the <em>object</em> in
the method call <code>object.method()</code> must be an <em>object reference</em>.
You are not limited to using the object's name here (if it even has one), you can
use an expression to determine the object to which to send a message. One common
use of an expression as object reference is just after an object is created. For
example, you can create an object and immediately thereafter call one of its methods:
<blockquote>
<pre>
new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 50).equals(anotherRect)
</pre>
</blockquote>
The expression <code>new Rectangle(0, 0, 100, 50)</code> evaluates to an
object reference that refers to a Rectangle object. Thus you can use the
dot notation to then call the new rectangle's <code>equals()</code> method
to determine if the new rectangle is equal to the one specified in
<code>equals()</code>'s argument list.
</blockquote>

<a name=variables>
<h4>Referencing an Object's Variables</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
You reference an object's variables in the same way that you
call its methods--simply append the variable name to an object
reference with an intervening '.' (period).
<blockquote>
<pre>
object.variable
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can use this notation to either view or modify an object's variables.
For example, we can change <code>rect</code>'s height and width using
the following two statements:
<blockquote>
<pre>
rect.height = 15;
rect.width = 37;
</pre>
</blockquote>
Or you can calculate the rectangle's area using these statements
<blockquote>
<pre>
area = rect.height * rect.width;
</pre>
</blockquote>
Similar to method calls, when you reference a variable through an object,
you are referencing a particular instances variables. If <code>bob</code>
and <code>rect</code> are both rectangles of different height and widths,
this instruction
<blockquote>
<pre>
area = rect.height * rect.width;
</pre>
</blockquote>
calculates the area of the rectangle named <code>rect</code> and
this instruction
<blockquote>
<pre>
area = bob.height * bob.width;
</pre>
</blockquote>
calculates the area of the rectangle named <code>bob</code>.
<p>
As with method calls, the <em>object</em> in <code>object.variable</code> must
be an <em>object reference</em>. You are not limited to using just the object's
name here (if it even has one), you can use an expression to specify the object
whose variables you want to inspect. One common use of an expression as object
reference is just after an object is created. For example, you can find out
the height of an uninitialized Rectangle with:
<blockquote>
<pre>
height = new Rectangle().height;
</pre>
</blockquote>
