<h2>
    Controlling Access to a Class's Methods
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The Java language supports five distinct access levels for
methods: private, private protected, protected, public, and,
if left unspecified, "friendly". The following chart shows
the access level permitted by each specifier.
<blockquote>
<pre>
				sub-	pack-
Specifier		class	class	age	world
-----------------------------------------------------
private			X
private protected	X	X
protected		X	X*	X
public			X	X	X	X

friendly		X	 	X
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first column indicates whether or not the class itself can call
the method defined by the access specifier. The second
column indicates whether or not subclasses of the class (regardless of
which package they are in) can call the method. The
third column indicates whether or not classes in the same package
(regardless of their parentage) as the class can call the
method. And finally, the fourth column indicates that all
classes can call the method.
<p>
You'll note that the protected access specifier/sub-class intersection
has an '*' -- this indicates that this particular access case
has a special caveat which is discussed in detail <a href=#protectedcaveat>below</a>.
<p>
Let's look at each access level in more detail.

<h4>Private</h4>
<blockquote>
Let's begin with the most restrictive access level--private.
Only the class in which a private method is defined can call that
method. To declare a private method, use the keyword <code>private</code>.
For example, the following class defines one private method within it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    private void iamprivate() {
	System.out.println("iamprivate");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Objects of type Alpha can call the <code>iamprivate()</code> method,
but objects of other types cannot. For example, the following class,
regardless of which package it is in or its parentage, cannot call
the <code>iamprivate()</code> method within the Alpha class.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprivate();		// illegal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can tell when one of your classes is attempting to access a method to
which it does not have access--the compiler will print an error message similar
to the following and refuse to compile your program.
<blockquote>
<pre>
Beta.java:12: No method matching iamprivate() found in class Alpha.
        a.iamprivate();		// illegal
1 error
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Private Protected</h4>
<blockquote>
The next most restrictive access specified is private protected. This
access level includes the same access level as private plus allows
any of the class's subclasses to call the method.
To declare a private protected method, use the keywords <code>private protected</code>.
For example, the following class defines one private protected method within it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    private protected void iamprivateprotected() {
	System.out.println("iamprivateprotected");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Objects of type Alpha can call the <code>iamprivateprotected()</code>
method. In addition, subclasses of Alpha also have access to
<code>iamprivateprotected()</code>. For instance, this subclass of
Alpha can call the <code>iamprivateprotected()</code> method of
another Alpha object.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta extends Alpha {
    void modifyVariable(Alpha a) {
        a.iamprivateprotected();	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The output from this method call will be the string
<blockquote>
<pre>
iamprivateprotected
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Protected</h4>
<blockquote>
The next access level specifier is protected which allows the class itself,
subclasses (with a caveat), and all classes in the same package to call
the method.
To declare a protected method, use the keyword <code>protected</code>.
For example, take this version of the Alpha class which
is now declared to be within a package named "Greek" and which has a
single protected method declared within it.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Alpha {
    protected void iamprotected() {
	System.out.println("iamprotected");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now, suppose that the class, Beta, was also declared to be a member of
the Greek package. The Beta class can legally call the <code>iamprotected()</code>
method declared within the Alpha class.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprotected();	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The output from this method call will be the string
<blockquote>
<pre>
iamprotected
</pre>
</blockquote>
<a name=protectedcaveat>
That's pretty straightforward.</a> Now, let's investigate how subclasses of
Alpha can access protected methods.
<p>
Let's introduce a new class, Gamma, that
derives from Alpha but lives in a different package. The Gamma class can
access the <code>iamprotected()</code> method, but only on objects of type
Gamma or its subclasses. For example, the <code>accessMethod()</code>
of the following class attempts to access the <code>iamprotected()</code>
method on an object of type ProtectedAlpha, which is illegal, and on an object
of type Gamma, which is legal.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Gamma {
    void accessMethod(ProtectedAlpha a) {
        a.iamprotected = 10;		// illegal
        this.iamprotected = 10;		// illegal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
If a class is both a subclass of and in the same package as the class
with the protected variable, then the class has access to the protected
method (its package status takes precedence over its subclass status).
</blockquote>

<h4>Public</h4>
<blockquote>
Now for the easiest access specifier--public. To declare a public method,
use the keyword <code>public</code>. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Alpha {
    public void iampublic() {
	System.out.println("iampublic");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Any class, in any package, can call a class's public methods.
For example, this version of the Beta class
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
	Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iampublic();			// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
can legally call the <code>iampublic()</code> method
in the Alpha class.
</blockquote>

<h4>Friendly</h4>
<blockquote>
And finally, the last access level is what you get if you don't
explicitly set a method's access level to one of the previous levels.
This access level is known as "friendly".
For example, this version of the Alpha class declares a single
friendly method and lives within the Greek package.
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Alpha {
    void iamfriendly() {
	System.out.println("iamfriendly");
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The Alpha class can call the <code>iamfriendly()</code> method.
In addition, all the classes declared within the same package as
Alpha can also call <code>iamfriendly()</code>.
For example, suppose that both Alpha and Beta were declared
as part of the Greek package, then this Beta class
<blockquote>
<pre>
package Greek;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprotected();	// legal
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
could legally call <code>iamfriendly()</code>.
