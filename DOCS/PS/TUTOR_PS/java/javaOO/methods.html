<h2>
    Writing a Method
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As you know, objects have behaviour and that behaviour is implemented
by its methods. Other objects can ask an object to do something by
invoking its methods. This section tells you everything you need to know
to write methods for your Java classes. For more information about
how to call methods see <a href="../../MissingPage.html">Missing Page</a>.
<p>
At minimum a method declaration has a return type indicating the data type
of the value returned by the method, a name, and a method body that contains
the Java instructions that implement the method:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<em>return_type</em> <em>method_name()</em> {
    . . .
    <em>method body</em>
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
For example, the following is a method declaration of a simple method
that returns a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether or not
something is empty.
<blockquote>
<pre>
boolean isEmpty() {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Alone this method has no meaning--is <em>what</em> empty?
This is because this particular method declaration is not associated
with any class. It is the combination of a class and a method that
gives meaning to a method. In Java, methods are associated with classes
or objects and operate on the class or object with which they are
associated. The results you get from the <code>isEmpty()</code> method
only have meaning if the method is associated with a stack object, or
an array object, or some other type of object that can contain objects
or data.
<p>
In Java every method <em>must</em> be within a class declaration.
An earlier section, <a href="declaringclass.html">Declaring a Class</a>,
showed you the general outline of a class declaration:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class declaration {
    . . .
    class body
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Within the class you define all the variables and methods supported
by that class. This page focuses on how to declare and implement methods for
a class. The <a href="variables.html">next page</a> shows you how
to declare your class's methods.
<p>
You declare all of the methods that are a member of the class within
the class body. Typically, you declare a class's methods after
you declare its variables, although this is not required.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class declaration {
    . . .
    <em>member variable declarations</em>
    . . .
    <em>method declarations</em>
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Let's put the <code>isEmpty()</code> method in an appropriate class:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class stack {
    . . .
    boolean isEmpty() {
        . . .
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Now, we can say that the <code>isEmpty()</code> methods returns true
when the stack is empty and returns false otherwise.
<p>
The method declaration shown above is a very basic method declaration.
Methods have many other attributes such as parameters, access control,
and so on.

<h4>Returning a Value from a Method</h4>
<blockquote>
Java requires that a method declare the data type of the value that
it returns. If a method returns no value, it can be declared to return
<code>void</code>.
<p>
There are two major categories
of data types in the Java language: simple types and complex types.
Simple data types are comprised of a single value and include
integer numbers, floating point numbers, boolean values, and characters
(a single character, that is). Complex types are comprised of multiple
or complex values and, sometimes, the operations that can be performed
on those values. Complex types include classes, interfaces, and arrays.
<p>
Methods can return either values of simple data types or of complex data
types. For example, this method returns a simple data type, a boolean value:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Stack {
    static final int STACK_EMPTY = -1;
    Object stackelements[];
    int topelement = STACK_EMPTY;
    . . .
    boolean isEmpty() {
	if (topelement == STACK_EMPTY)
            return true;
	else
            return false;
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The <code>return</code> operator returns the value and must be the last
statement in the method. Any method that is <em>not</em> declared <code>void</code>
must contain a <code>return</code> statement.
The <code>return</code> operator places the indicated value on the stack where the
calling method can then retrieve it.
<p>
The following method returns a complex data type: an object.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Stack {
    static final int STACK_EMPTY = -1;
    Object stackelements[];
    int topelement = STACK_EMPTY;
    . . .
    Object pop() {
	if (topelement == STACK_EMPTY)
	    return null;
	else {
	    return stackelements[topelement--];
	}
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The data type of the value returned by the <code>return</code> statement
must match the data type that the method claims to return. For example,
you can't return an Object from a method declared to return an integer.
When returning an object the object must either derive from, or be the
class indicated.
If your method returns an interface type, the object returned must
implement that interface.

</blockquote>

<h4>A Method's Name</h4>
<blockquote>
A method name can be any legal Java identifier.
There are two special cases to consider in regards to Java method names.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Java supports method name overloading so multiple methods can
share the same name. For example, suppose you were writing a class that
can render various types of data to its drawing area. You would need to
write a method that knew how to render each data type. In other languages,
you would have to think of a new name for each method: <code>drawString()</code>,
<code>drawInteger()</code>, <code>drawFloat()</code>, and so on. In Java, you
can use the same name for all of the drawing methods but pass in a different
type of parameter to each method. So, in your data rendering class,
you can declare three methods named <code>draw()</code> each of which
takes a different type parameter:
<blockquote>
<pre>
class DataRenderer {
    void draw(String s) {
        . . .
    }
    void draw(int i) {
        . . .
    }
    void draw(float f) {
        . . .
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<strong>Note:</strong> The information within the ( and ) in the
method declaration are parameters to the method. Parameters are covered
later in this section in <a href="../../MissingPage.html>Missing Page</a>.
<hr>
The methods are differentiated by the compiler by the number and type of
the arguments passed into the method. Thus, <code>draw(String s)</code>
and <code>draw(int i)</code> are distinct and unique; and, <code>draw(String s)</code>
and <code>draw(String t)</code> are identical and will result in a compiler error.
Overloaded methods must return the same data type.
<li>
Any method whose name is the same as the name of the class in which the
method is defined is a constructor method and has a special duty to perform.
Constructors are used to create and initialize a new object of the class
type. For more information about how to create an object, see
<a href="objectcreation.html">Creating an Object</a>.
For more information about how to write a constructor, see
<a href="constructors.html">Writing a Constructor Method</a>.
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h4><a href="../../MissingPage.html">A Method's Body</a></h4>
<blockquote>
The method body is where all of the action of a method takes place.
The method body contains all of the legal Java instructions that
implement the method.
<ul>
<li>
Passing Information into and out of Methods
(pass by reference)
<li>
Using this & super
</ul>
