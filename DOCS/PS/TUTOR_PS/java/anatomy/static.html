<h2>
    Static vs. Instance
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
 
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.util.Date;
class DateApp {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Date today = new Date();
        <strong>System.out.println(today);</strong>
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The last line of the <code>main()</code> method uses
the System class from the java.lang package to display the
current date and time.
First, let's break down the line of code that invokes the
<code>println</code> method, then look at the details of
the argument passed to it.

<h4>Static Methods and Variables</h4>
<blockquote>
In the Java statement
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>System.out.println(today);</strong>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<code>System.out</code> refers to the
<code>out</code> variable of the System class.
As you can see, to refer an class's static variables and methods, you use a syntax
similar to the C and C++ syntax for obtaining the elements in a structure.
You join the class's name and the name of the static method or 
static variable together with a period ('.').
<p>
Notice that the application never instantiated the System class and
that <code>out</code> is referred to directly from the class. This is because <code>out</code>
is declared as a <em>static variable</em>--a variable associated
with the class rather than with an instance of the class.
You can also associate methods with a class--<em>static methods</em>--
using <code>static</code>.
</blockquote>

<h4>Instance Methods and Variables</h4>
<blockquote>
Methods and variables that are not declared as <code>static</code>
are known as <em>instance methods</em> and <em>instance
variables</em>. To refer to instance methods and variables, you must
instantiate the class first, then obtain the methods and variables
from the instance.
<p>
System's <code>out</code> variable is an object, an instance of the
PrintStream class (from the java.io package), that implements the
<em>standard output stream</em>.
<a href="../nutsandbolts/output.html">The Standard Output Stream</a>
<a href="../nutsandbolts/output.html"><img src=../../images/javaIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
in <em>The Nuts and Bolts of the Java Language</em>
discusses the standard output stream in detail. For now, just think of
it as a convenient place for an application to display its results.
<p>
System creates <code>out</code>, and all of its other static variables,
when the System class is loaded into the application.
The next part of the Java statement calls one of <code>out</code>'s
instance methods: <code>println()</code>.
<blockquote>
<pre>
out.println()
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
As you see, you refer to an object's instance methods and variables similar
to the way you refer a class's static methods and variables.
You join the object's name and the name of the instance method or 
instance variable together with a period ('.').
<p>
The Java compiler allows you to cascade
these references to static and instance methods and variables
together and use the construct that appears in
the listing above
<blockquote>
<pre>
System.out.println()
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Sum it Up</h4>
<blockquote>
Static variables and methods are also known as <em>class variables</em> or
<em>class methods</em> because <em>each class variable and each class method occurs
once per class</em>. Instance methods and variables occur
once per instance of a class.
