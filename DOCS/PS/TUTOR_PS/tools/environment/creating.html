<h2>
    Roll Your Own Packages
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Packages are groups of related classes and interfaces
and provide convenient a mechanism for managing a large
set of classes and interfaces and avoiding naming conflicts.
Several packages are included as part of the Java
development environment: the Java language packages, the
browser packages, and the window toolkit package just
to name a few.
<p>
In addition to the Java packages, you can create your
own packages using Java's <code>package</code> statement.
Suppose that you had a group of classes that implement
a collection of graphic objects such as circles, rectangles,
lines, and points. In addition to these classes you also
defined an interface Draggable [PENDING: does this make sense?]
It makes sense to collect all of these classes and interfaces
together into a package called "Graphics". In this way other
programmers can easily determine what the group of classes are
for and how they relate to one another and to other classes
and packages.
<p>
You create a package implicitly when you put a class or classes
in it. Here's an outline of the Graphics package described in the
previous paragraph.
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>package Graphics;</strong>

class Circle {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first line in the preceding code snippet indicates that
all of the classes defined in this compilation unit are members
of a package named <code>Graphics</code>.
The package statement refers to everything in the current
compilation unit (in most cases a compilation unit is a
file). You can define a class per file and have each class
be in the same package.

<p>
All classes and interfaces are in a package.
Default package.
