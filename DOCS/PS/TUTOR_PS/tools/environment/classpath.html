<h2>
    The CLASSPATH Environment Variable
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

To run a stand-alone Java application, you specify the name of
the Java application that you wish to execute to the Java interpreter.
To run an applet, you specify the applet's name with an APP tag within
an HTML file. The HotJava browser passes the applet's name to the
Java interpreter.
In either case, the application or applet that you are
running could be anywhere on your system or on the network. Also,
the application or applet might use other classes or objects that
are in the same or different location.
<p>
Because your classes could be anywhere, you must indicate to the
Java interpreter where it can find the classes that you are trying to run.
You do this with the CLASSPATH environment variable.
The CLASSPATH environment variable is comprised of a list of
directory names that contain compiled Java classes.
The actual construct of CLASSPATH depends on the
<a href=_classpath.html>system</a> you are running.
<p>
When the interpreter gets a classname, either from the command line,
from the HotJava browser, or from an application or applet, the interpreter
searches each directory in the CLASSPATH until it finds the
class it's looking for.
<p>
You should put the top-level directory that contains your Java classes in your
CLASSPATH. By convention, many people have a <code>classes</code> directory
in their home directory where they put all of the Java code. If you have
such a directory, you should put that directory in your CLASSPATH. However,
when you are working with applets, it's convenient to put the applet
in a <code>classes</code> directory underneath the directory
where the HTML file is that contains the applet.
For this and other reasons, it's often convenient to put dot
('.')--the current directory--in the CLASSPATH as well.
<p>
The classes included with the Java development environment are automatically
available to you because the interpreter automatically appends the
correct directory to your CLASSPATH when it starts up.

<h4>Order is Important</h4>
<blockquote>
When the Java interpreter is looking for a class, it searches the
directories indicated by your CLASSPATH in order until it finds a class
with the correct name. The Java interpreter runs the first class
with the correct name that it encounters and does not search the
remaining directories. Normally, it's best to
give your classes unique names, but if you can't avoid it, make
sure that your CLASSPATH searches your classes in the proper order.
Keep this in mind when setting up your
CLASSPATH and your source code hierarchy.
