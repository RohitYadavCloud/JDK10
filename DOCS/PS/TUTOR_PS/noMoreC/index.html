<blockquote>

This lesson contains several independent pages that discuss the differences
between the Java language and C and C++. If you are primarily interested
in these differences, you can step through these pages using the
<a href="../index.html"><img src=../images/PreviousArrow.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
and
<a href="dataTypes.html"><img src=../images/NextArrow.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
at the top and bottom of each page.

<p>
However, if you prefer to learn about the differences between the languages
in context of more information just proceed with the other lessons.
When applicable those lessons will transport you to one of the pages listed
below to get detailed information about the differences between these languages.

<h4><a href="dataTypes.html">C Data Types Not Supported By the Java Language</a>
