<h1>
     Overview of the Java UI
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

This lesson gives an overview of what the Java environment 
provides to help you create a user interface (UI).
<em>UI</em> is a broad term that refers to all sorts of
communication between a program and its users.
UI is not only what the user sees,
but what the user hears and feels.
Even the speed with which a program interacts with the user
is an important part of the program's UI.
This lesson covers some Java classes
that provide UI-related functionality.
Eventually, we hope to provide a UI style guide,
to give you more help with the art of designing a UI.
<p>

The Java environment provides classes for the following functionality:
<ul>
<li> <b>Displaying text using standard input and output --</b>
     Standard input and output are the old-fashioned way
     of presenting a user interface.
     They're still useful for testing and debugging programs,
     as well as for functionality that's not aimed at the typical end-user.
     See 
<a href="../../MissingPage.html">Input and Output Streams</a><a href="../../MissingPage.html"><img src="../../images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Writing Java Programs trail)"></a>
     for information on using standard input and output.
<li> <b>Playing sounds -- </b>
     All our sound-playing capabilities are either platform-dependent
     or applet-specific.
     [point to further info]
<li> <b>Saving user preferences using properties -- </b>
     For information that applets and applications
     need to save even when they're not running,
     you can use <em>properties.</em>
     Applets may have problems using properties, 
     due to security restrictions [check].
     [point to further info]
<li> <b>Getting applet attributes --</b>
     Attributes are an applet-only mechanism
     for getting user preferences.
<li> <b>Presenting a graphical UI (GUI) --</b>
     The rest of this lesson gives an overview of the Java GUI support. 
</ul>

Applets and applications commonly present information to the user
(and invite the user's interaction)
using a GUI.
The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) contains 
a complete set of classes for writing GUI programs.
<p>

<h4>
<a href=components.html>AWT Components</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
The AWT provides many standard GUI components
such as buttons, lists, menus, and text areas.
It also includes containers
(such as windows and menu bars)
and higher-level components
(such as a dialog for opening or saving files).
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=../../MissingPage.html>Other AWT Classes</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Other classes in the AWT include those for working with
graphics contexts (including basic drawing operations),
images, events, fonts, and colors.
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=anatomy.html>The Anatomy of a GUI-Based Program</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
The AWT provides a framework for drawing and event handling.
Using a program-specific hierarchy of containers and components, 
the AWT forwards events (such as mouse clicks)
to the appropriate object.
The same hierarchy determines the order in which
containers and components draw themselves.
