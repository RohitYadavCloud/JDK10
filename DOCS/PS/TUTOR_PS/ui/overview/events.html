<h2>
    Event Handling
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

When the user acts on a Component -- 
clicking it or pressing the Return key, for example --
an Event object is created.
The AWT event-handling system
passes the Event up the Component hierarchy,
giving each Component a chance to react to the event
before the window system fully processes it.
Each Component's event handler can either ignore an event
or react to it in any of the following ways:
<ul>
<li> by modifying the Event instance before it goes further up the hierarchy --
     for example, a TextField subclass that displays all letters in uppercase
     might react to the keypress of a lowercase letter 
     by changing the Event to contain the uppercase version of the letter
<li> by reacting in some other way to the event --
     for example, a TextField subclass (or a TextField's Container)
     could react to a Return keypress 
     by calling a method that processes the text field's contents
<li> by stopping the event from being processed further --
     for example, if an invalid character is entered in a text field,
     an event handler could simply stop the Event 
     from being processed any further
</ul>
<p>

From a Component's view, the AWT event-handling system is 
more like an event-<em>filtering</em> system.
Window-system-dependent code generates an event,
but Components get a chance to modify, react to, or destroy
the event
before the window-system-dependent code fully processes the event.
[CHECK -- is this the best, most correct way of saying this?]
The following [NON-EXISTENT] figure shows the chain of event handling
for a TextField event in the 
<a href=example/Converter.java>example program.</a>

<strong>Note:</strong>
In the current release, 
mouse events are forwarded to Components
<em>after</em> the window-system-dependent code has fully processed the event.
So although Components can intercept all <em>keyboard</em> events,
they can't currently intercept <em>mouse</em> events.
<p>



<h4>The Event Object</h4>
<blockquote>
Each event results in the creation of an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Event.html">Event</a><a href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Event.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>
object.
An Event object includes the following information:
<ul>
<li> The type of the event -- for example,
     a key press or mouse click, 
     or a more abstract event such as an "action" or window iconification.
     
<li> The object that was the "target" of the event -- for example,
     the Button corresponding to the onscreen button the user clicked,
     or the TextField corresponding to the field that user just typed in.

<li> A timestamp indicating when the event occurred.

<li> The location (x,y) where the event occurred.

<li> The key that was pressed (for keyboard events).

<li> An arbitrary argument (such as the string displayed on the Component)
     associated with the Event.

<li> The state of the modifier keys when the event occurred.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>How to Implement an Event Handler</h4>
<blockquote>
Components can respond to events by implementing the
<code><a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#handleEvent(java.awt.Event)>handleEvent()</a></code>
method or by
implementing a method that's
specific to one type of event.
The latter works because the default (Component)
definition of the <code>handleEvent()</code> method
simply calls a method that's specific to the event type.
These event-specific methods are
<code><a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseEnter>mouseEnter()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseExit>mouseExit()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseMove>mouseMove()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseUp>mouseUp()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseDown>mouseDown()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#mouseDrag>mouseDrag()</a>,
<a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#keyDown>keyDown()</a>, </code>
and
<code><a href=http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#action>action()</a>.</code>
<p>

<strong>Important:</strong>
All event handler methods must execute quickly!
Otherwise, they'll destroy the perceived performance of your program.
If you need to perform some lengthy operation as the result of
an event,
do it by starting up another thread 
(or sending a request to another thread)
to perform the operation.
For help on using threads,
see
<a href="../../java/threads/index.html">Threads of Control</a><a href="../../java/threads/index.html"><img src="../../images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Writing Java Programs trail)"></a>
<p>

In the example program,
all the event handling is performed by ConversionPanels.
They use the <code>handleEvent()</code> method 
to catch events resulting from user actions
on the slider (Scrollbar),
text field (TextField),
and pop-up list (Choice).
<p>

Here is the ConversionPanel implementation of the 
<code>handleEvent()</code> method:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public boolean handleEvent(Event e) {
    if (e.target instanceof Scrollbar) {
        textField.setText(String.valueOf(slider.getValue()));
        controller.convert(this);
    } else if ((e.target instanceof TextField) 
    	       && (e.id == Event.ACTION_EVENT)) {
        setSliderValue(getValue());
        controller.convert(this);
    } else if ((e.target instanceof Choice)
    	       && (e.id == Event.ACTION_EVENT)) {
        controller.convert(this);
    } 
    return false;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The method simply makes sure
that the ConversionPanel's slider and text field both show the same value,
and then asks the Converter object to update the other ConversionPanel.
The method always returns <code>false</code>
so that the event will be fully processed.
We would return <code>true</code>
if we wanted to stop the event from being processed further.
<p>
