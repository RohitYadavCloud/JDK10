<h2>
    General Rules for Using Layout Managers
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

<!--possible applet:  custom Container that has buttons letting
us add/delete Components, and lets us know when the layout-related
methods are called. -->

Unless you explicitly tell a Container not to use a layout manager,
it will be associated with its very own instance of a layout manager.
This layout manager is automatically consulted every time
the Container might need to change its appearance.
Except for GridBagLayout,
most layout managers don't require
applications and applets to directly call the layout manager's methods.

<h4>

How to Create a Layout Manager and Associate It with a Container
</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Every container has a default layout manager associated with it.
If you want to use this default, you don't have to do a thing.
The constructor for each Container 
creates a layout manager instance
and initializes the Container to use it.
<p>

To use a non-default layout manager,
you need to create an instance of the desired layout manager class
and tell the Container to use it.
Below is some typical code that does this.
This code creates a CardLayout manager
and sets it up as the layout manager for a Container.
<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
aContainer.setLayout(new CardLayout());
</pre>

<h4>
<a name=using>
Rules of Thumb for Using Layout Managers
</a>
</h4>

<blockquote>
The Container methods that result in calls to the Container's layout manager are
<code>add()</code>,
<code>remove()</code>,
<code>removeAll()</code>,
<code>layout()</code>,
<code>preferredSize()</code>,
and <code>minimumSize()</code>.
The
<code>add()</code>,
<code>remove()</code>, and
<code>removeAll()</code>
methods add and remove Components from a Container;
you can call them at any time.
The 
<code>layout()</code> method,
which is called as the result of any paint request to a Container, 
requests that the Container
place and size itself and the Components it contains;
you don't call it
directly [CHECK].
The <code>preferredSize()</code> 
and <code>minimumSize()</code> methods
return the Container's ideal size and minimum size, respectively.
The values returned are just hints;
they have no effect unless your program enforces these sizes [CHECK].
<P>

You must take special care
when calling a Container's <code>preferredSize()</code>
and <code>minimumSize()</code> methods.
The values these methods return are meaningless unless the Container
and its Components have valid peer objects.
The peer object corresponding to a Component 
is created whenever the Component's
<code>addNotify()</code> method is called,
which happens:
<ul>
<li> when the Component is a peer-less Window,
     or is contained in a peer-less Window,
     and the Window's
     <code>pack()</code> or <code>show()</code> method is called
<li> when the Component is added to a Container that already has a peer
<li> when your program directly calls
     the Component's <code>addNotify()</code> method,
     or the <code>addNotify()</code> method
     of any Container above the Component
     [is this really OK?]
</ul>
