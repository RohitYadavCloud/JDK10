<h1>
     Using Layout Managers
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

This lesson tells you how to use layout managers.
First, it tells you how to use the layout managers
that we provide.
Next, it shows how to position Components
without using a layout manager.
Finally, it tells you how to create your own layout manager.
<p>

The layout managers we provide range from the very simple 
(FlowLayout and GridLayout)
to the special purpose (BorderLayout and CardLayout)
to the ultra-flexible (GridBagLayout).
<p>

<h4>
<a href=border.html>BorderLayout</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
BorderLayout is the default layout manager for all Windows,
such as Frames and Dialogs.
It uses five areas to hold components:
north, south, east, west, and center.
All extra space is placed in the center area.
Here's a picture of a program that puts one button in each area.

<h4>
<a name=CardEx>
<a href=card.html>CardLayout</a></a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Use the CardLayout class when you have an area
that can contain different Components at different times.
CardLayouts are commonly tied to Choices,
with the state of the Choice determining
which Panel (group of Components)
the CardLayout displays.
Here are two pictures of a program that uses a Choice
and CardLayout in this way.

</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=flow.html>FlowLayout</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
FlowLayout is the default layout manager for all Panels.
It simply lays out components 
from left to right,
centering them within their row
and, if necessary, starting new rows.
Both Panels in the CardLayout figure <a href=#CardEx>above</a> use FlowLayouts.
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=gridbag.html>GridBagLayout</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
GridBagLayout is the most sophisticated, flexible layout manager we provide.
It aligns components vertically and horizontally, 
without requiring that the components be the same size.
Here's a picture of a program that uses a GridBagLayout
to manage ten buttons in a panel.

</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=grid.html>GridLayout</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
GridLayouts simply make a bunch of Components have equal size,
displaying them in the requested number of rows and columns.
Here's a picture of a program with a Panel that uses a GridLayout
to control the display of 5 buttons.  
<p>

</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=none.html>Doing Without a Layout Manager</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
You can position Components using absolute coordinates
without using a layout manager.
Here's a picture of a program 
with a panel that sets its layout manager to null
and then positions three buttons.

<h4>
<a href=custom.html>Creating a Custom Layout Manager</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Instead of using one of our layout managers,
you can write your own.
Layout managers must implement the LayoutManager interface,
which specifies the five methods every layout manager must define.
Here's a picture of a program
that uses a custom layout manager
to position components diagonally across a panel.
