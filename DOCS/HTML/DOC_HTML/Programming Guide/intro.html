<h3>Disclaimer!</h3>
<blockquote>
This guide is a <strong>DRAFT</strong>.
It's incomplete, buggy, and contains links to "ghost" lessons
(lessons that we are working on and that aren't yet available).
We're making this guide available to you for two reasons:
<ol>
<li> So you can learn from it --
     some of the information in this guide
     is not documented anywhere else.
<li> So we can get feedback on this guide.
</ol>

To help us with #2, please let us know what's confusing in these lessons,
what seems unnecessary,
and whether the lessons helped you at all.
Write us at 
<a href="mailto:java@java.sun.com">java@java.sun.com</a>
or submit a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/GettingInTouch/BugReport.html">bug report</a>.

in this Draft?

<h4>Upgrades, Bug Fixes, and Face-Lifts. Oh My!</h4>

For the third draft, we've:
<ul>
<li>
made the few changes necessary to reflect Beta instead of Pre-Beta.
<li>
changed the name of this document from
"The Java Programmer's Guide" to
"The Java Language Tutorial: Object-Oriented Programming for the Internet."
Why the long name?
This document is going to be published as a book,
and we wanted to make sure the title
was as descriptive as possible,
without requiring much prior knowledge of the potential buyer.
<li>
added ALT text to our link graphics, 
so that people using non-graphical browsers
can understand the information the graphic was conveying.
</ul>

<p>
Here are the changes that occurred between the second and first drafts:
<ul>
<li>
Everything was updated to reflect the new APIs (except for <i>The "run:"
Protocol Handler</i> and <i>The "text/plain" Content Handler</i>
in the <a href="getStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a>
<a href="getStarted/index.html"><img src="images/getStartedIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
trail).
<li>
We fixed many typos, clarified many obfuscations, fixed
broken links and miscommunications.
<li>
We got a face-lift with new icons and a new page design.
</ul>

<h4>New Trails and New Lessons</h4>

We've added a few pages to the third draft: 
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="ui/index.html"><img src="images/uiIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
The <a href="ui/index.html">Creating a User Interface</a>
trail has a new lessons:
<a href="ui/layout/index.html>Using Layout Managers</a>, which [ . . . ].
</dl>

The second draft has the following additions to the first draft:
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="applet/index.html"><img src="images/appletIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
The <a href="applet/index.html">Writing Applets</a>
trail has a new lesson:
<a href="applet/anatomy/index.html">The Anatomy of an Applet</a>
which describes
how applets work and how you use the Applet class to create an applet.

<dt>
<a href="ui/index.html"><img src="images/uiIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
The new <a href="ui/index.html">Creating a User Interface</a>
trail has two new lessons:
<a href="ui/overview/index.html>Overview of UI Elements</a> which
introduces you to the objects that the Java development environment
provides for building UIs, and 
<a href="ui/anatomy/index.html>Anatomy of a Program with a Graphical UI</a>
which explains the Component hierarchy and how it relates to event handling and
drawing.

<dt>
<a href="tools/index.html"><img src="images/toolIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
We've added a trail <a href="tools/index.html">The Java Development Environment</a>
that provides a tour of the packages provided with the development environment,
talks about the different tools including the new prototype debugger. This trail
includes a lesson on <a href="tools/system/index.html">Using System Resources</a>.

<dt>
<a href="native/index.html"><img src="images/nativeIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
We've also added the
<a href="native/index.html">Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</a>
trail that shows you how to integrate native methods
into your Java programs. Currently, this trail contains two lessons.
The first, <a href="native/stepbystep/index.html">Step By Step</a>,
 walks you through an example showing you each step you take to
implement a native method. The second, 
<a href="native/example/index.html">A Comprehensive Example</a>,
which is largely unfinished, is an example that implements a
"character-replacement" program using native methods.

<dt>
<a href="java/index.html"><img src="images/javaIcon.gif" align=left width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
<dd>
And finally, two new lessons have been added to the
<a href="java/index.html">Writing Java Programs</a>
trail:
<a href="java/threads/index.html">Threads of Control</a>
and
<a href="java/objects/index.html">Object-Oriented Programming Concepts: A Primer</a>.

<h3>About the Applet References in the Document</h3>
<blockquote>
Applet references in these pages actually contain references to two
different versions of the applet:
<ul>
<li>
a 1.0alpha3 compatible version
which you can view these using the 1.0alpha3 version of the HotJava browser
<li>
a Beta-compatible version which you can view these
using the appletviewer or other Beta-compatible browser
</ul>
<br>

<strong>
Note to 1.0alpha3 Developers:
</strong>
This programmer's guide doesn't contain any information on how to
upgrade your 1.0alpha3 Java applets to the 1.0 Beta release.
For more information on how to do this please refer to
<a href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-beta/converting/index.html">Converting Applets</a>.
