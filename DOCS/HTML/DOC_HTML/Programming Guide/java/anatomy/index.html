<h1>
     The Anatomy of a Java Application
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

Java programs that run within a Java-compatible browser are known as <em>applets</em>.
This lesson discusses the components of a stand-alone Java program,
that is, a program written in the Java language that runs independently of
any browser. Stand-alone Java programs are also known as <em>Java applications</em>.
For a quick, no-nonsense introduction to writing applets, see
<a href=../../getStarted/applet/index.html>The "Hello World" Applet</a>
<a href=../../getStarted/applet/index.html><img src=../../images/getStartedIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>.
<p>
With all the fuss being made about object-oriented programming
and design, you might think that you need a Ph.D. to sort through it.
Fear not. Along with descriptions of the components of a Java program,
this lesson provides a simple introduction to the fundamental concepts
of object-oriented programming--<em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>--
through a simple Java application.

<h4>Print the Current Date and Time</h4>
<blockquote>
The following application, called <code>DateApp</code>,
displays the current date and time.
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.util.Date;
class DateApp {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
        Date today = new Date(); 
        System.out.println(today);
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The program is a modified version
of the canonical "Hello World" application found in
<a href=../../getStarted/application/index.html>The "Hello World" Application</a>
<a href=../../getStarted/application/index.html><img src=../../images/getStartedIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>.
The next page of this lesson provides a
<a href=diff.html>Comparison of DateApp and "Hello World"</a>.
</blockquote>

<h4>A Note About Import</h4>
<blockquote>
The first line in the program <em>imports</em> the Date class from
the java.util package. Importing a class from a package makes that
class available to the file into which it was imported. The java.util
package is a collection of classes that provide miscellaneous
functionality. The Date class from the java.util package lets you
manage and manipulate calendar dates in a system independent way.

<a href="../../tools/packages/index.html"><em>Package Tour</em></a>
<a href="../../tools/packages/index.html"><img src=../../images/toolIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
provides an overview of all of the packages shipped as part of
the Java development environment and the classes contained within
each. Also,
<a href="../../tools/environment/packages.html">Creating and Using Packages</a>
<a href="../../tools/environment/packages.html"><img src=../../images/toolIcon.gif width=20 height=20 border=0></a>
discusses how to use packages and their objects and how to create your own.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=classdef.html>Defining a Class</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
In the Java language, all functions and variables exist within a <em>class</em> or an <em>object</em>--
the Java language does not support global functions or stray variables.
So, the skeleton of any Java application is a <em>class definition</em>.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=main.html>The main() Method</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
The brain of any Java application is its <code>main()</code> method.
When you run a Java application with the Java interpreter, you
specify the name of the class that you want to run. The interpreter
invokes the <code>main()</code> method defined within that class.
The <code>main()</code> method controls the flow of the program, allocates
whatever resources are needed, and runs any other methods that provide the
functionality for the application.
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a href=objects.html>An Introduction to Java Objects</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
The other corporeal components of a Java application are the
supporting objects, classes, methods and Java language statements
that you write to implement the application.
</blockquote>

<h4><a href=tools.html>Saving, Compiling and Running an Application</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Type in the program exactly as it appears above and save it to a file.
Then use the Java compiler to compile the program, and 
the Java interpreter to run it.
