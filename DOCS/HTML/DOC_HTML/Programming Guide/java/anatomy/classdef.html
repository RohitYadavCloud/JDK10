<h2>
    Defining a Class
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.util.Date;
<strong>class DateApp {</strong>
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Date today = new Date();
        System.out.println(today);
    }
<strong>}</strong>
</pre>
</blockquote>

The bold line in the <code>DateApp</code> application listing above
begins a <em>class definition block</em>. A class--the basic
building block of an object-oriented language such as the
Java language--is a template that describes the data and behaviour
associated with <em>instances</em> of that class. When you
<em>instantiate</em> a class you create an object that will
look and feel like other instances of the same class.
The data associated with a class or object are called <em>variables</em>;
the behaviour associated with class or object are called <em>methods</em>.
<p>
Julia Child's recipe for rack of lamb is a real-world example of a class.
Her rendition of the rack of lamb is one instance of the recipe,
and mine is quite another. (While both racks of lamb may "look and feel"
the same, I imagine that they "smell and taste" differently.)
<p>
A more traditional example of a class from the world of programming is
a class that represents a rectangle. The class would contain variables
for the origin of the rectangle, and its width and height. The class would
also contain a method that calculates the area of the rectangle.
An instance of the rectangle class would contain the information for a specific
rectangle: like the dimensions of the floor of your office, or
the dimensions of the window you are using to view this page.
<p>
In the Java language, the general form of a class definition is
<blockquote>
<pre>
class <em>name</em> {
    . . .
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
where the keyword <code>class</code> begins the class definition for a
class named <code>name</code>. The variables and methods of the class are
embraced by the curly brackets that begin and end the class definition block. 
<code>DateApp</code> has no variables and has a single
method named <code>main()</code>.
